The easiest way to look at inheritance is as an "...is a kind of" relationship.	Most of these languages provide an "extend" keyword, which is used to subclass another.

P(B) is the prior or marginal probability of B, and acts to normalise the probability.	* P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A.

Other possible uses for vector space models are indexing and also to rank the relevancy of differing documents.	In vector space model, the documents from which the information is to be retrieved are represented as vectors.

This can be useful when the number of times a word appears is not considered important.	Mathematicians use the word to describe a set of rules which anyone can follow to solve a problem.

As a formal theorem, Bayes' theorem is valid in all common interpretations of probability.	Bayes' Theorem is a theorem of probability theory originally stated by the Reverend Thomas Bayes.

This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	It does not take into account any information about B and therefore is considered "prior".
