you 'll need to check the particular policies of each publisher to see what is allowed and what is not allowed .	if you need to publish the book and you have found one publisher that allows it .
you should check the conditions of your journal using the sherpa / romeo list .	you should read the copyright transfer contract that you have signed .
it is not completely true that failures are not published .	one of the consequences of not reporting failures is publication bias .
i started one with that goal in mind back in high school ( i 'm in college now ) .	i have never heard of an academic journal specifically meant for high school students .
i am not aware of any university run participant pools .	at the universities i 've worked in north america , human-subject studies ( esp .
citing online articles without a clear author depends on the citation format .	there are probably several answers depending on the situation and on the standards in your field .
http : / / www.higheredjobs.com they have jobs broken down by job category , region , and institution type .	at this point i am a broken record : this is one of the situations i found myself in .
apart from admission ( which normally should not be related to age ) , there is something that 's related to your question .	age is not a phd admission facor in the continental europe , too .
receiving an invitation to help out at a nsf or nih study session is highly unlikely and logistically difficult .	reviewing grant proposals as a student is tricky , at least in some fields .
it might be worth mentioning this while you are applying for phd positions .	if the award is sufficiently prestigious then you should list it , otherwise you should not .
so far , i think this is better to make a rotation of the instructor .	aside from having common exams , one possibility is to withhold the names of the instructors until the registration is finished .
i think it predominately depends on how you are accessing the other university 's resources .	i would not explicitly acknowledge people who have helped you access papers that you don 't have access to .
yes , high-profile journals do typically edit figures for style and consistency .	as grauwulf comments , your job is to focus on the content .
aeismail makes an important point about location : what 's standard in germany differs from what 's standard in the us .	like so many other matters , your location plays a role in what is considered accepted or not .
i have been using a mode for emacs called org-mode to track my research and do project planning .	i highly recommend wunderkit ( recently released ) and wunderlist for organizing to-do list , and taking notes .
what 's the best way to make corrections to a published paper ?	journals oftentimes make their procedures regarding varying types of corrections available on their website ( e.g. , nature ) .
i recently attended the annual meetings of the european economic association .	one recent conference i 've heard that supports such an application is ubicomp 2012 .
if you 're a first / second year grad student , go because you have to .	let 's ask another question : is there at least one good reason not to go at the seminars ?
to add to other answers : how often one publishes in the most prestigious general journals ( e.g .	another thing is ( in conjunction with the number of publications ) the number of coauthors , i.e .
i think that the problem is that often many professors underestimate the phd student 's will and personal scientific aims .	one difficulty is that it 's far from clear what the ideal dropout rate should be .
this post refers to research in the stem fields , and may not be applicable to other research topics .	this is about my experience in computer engineering i found that reading for breadth was the more important approach .
hal ( " hyper archive en ligne " ) is a french open archive repository that covers all fields .	figshare is a rather new service ( compared to arxiv ) that is just starting to gain momentum .
if you don 't want to pay for adobe acrobat pro , as @ schultem mentions , latex can do this with embedded hyperlinks .	if you don 't mind hosting your files online , slideshare is a good solution .
i think your method ( thesis title in the education section ) is the standard one .	some people publish their theses as part of a monograph series .
i think it really depends on how long you plan to work without salary .	why not just bring up the idea of staying in your current lab with your advisor ?
my practice is to replace the initial preprint with the postprint as soon as it is accepted .	i believe you should never include " submitted to journal of blah " ; it conveys no information and it 's tacky .
doing outstanding research is what ultimately matters , not the rank of the university .	i don 't entirely disagree with the two previous answers : taking the offer you have now may be a fine choice .
i don 't think there are likely to be any standards that address this issue specifically .	you 're going to find answers all over the map for this one ( i.e. , there probably aren 't " standards " ) .
your question likely indicates that you need to work on your communication with your advisor .	my advice : don 't read everything otherwise you will never finish !
if your paper are on arxiv you can use myarticles widget .	an even easier solution that doesn 't require anything except the ability to upload a bibtex file is exhibit .
i know that tikz was mentioned already , but i think it deserve its own answer .	mathematica is actually good for making all sorts of graphics .
plain text / markup language for mathematics , i think tex / latex is the way to go .	binary / plain text other things to consider ( for the future ) is the movement towards standard meta-data items contained with the research articles ( e.g .
i 've seen three common ways of funding staff - undoubtedly there are more .	funding for non-research positions comes from either direct or indirect sources .
my answer would be depending on which gre are you referring to ?	the problem i see with the gres is that the scoring range is highly compressed .
a good starting point would be to talk to your research advisor about how to handle this , and follow his / her advice .	and , as a small point , if one 's work is confidential for the reason that it is so extremely useful / important / wonderful ( ! ? !
you could ask members of your doctoral committee to write you a letter of recommendation each .	you need to strategize with your advisor , or a trusted mentor , about this .
you should do what makes you happy and you find interesting .	you can definitely apply in a different field than your undergraduate .
if you have access to it , you can very easily do that with thomson reuters ’ web of science portal .	you can have a look at the arxiv cultoromics website at http : / / arxiv.culturomics.org , which however searches in articles on the arxiv .
i did this in the earlier stages of my career , when every little bit of cv weight helped .	on the one hand , it shows that you are engaged in this necessary part of scientific research that is peer-review .
i can also add some other pointer i 've come to learn over the years on what constitutes a good reviews .	there are certain things i look for when reviewing papers that are " show stoppers " , i.e .
a strong factor for most people will be the financial impact , i.e .	i applied to six graduate schools in my field , and was accepted at all of them .
i would allow rescheduling , but be sure to use a different exam .	in my school , redo exams have a maximum grade of the minimum grade to pass .
i have frequently had to micromanage my students ' presentations and writeups .	the first thing i would do is improve / repair your personal relationship with your adviser .
i 'm going to answer this question based on my understanding of copyright law in the united kingdom .	german copyright is very different from uk or us copyright .
in general there are a number of different distinct workflows that lead to a poster .	for completeness , apple 's pages has quite a few nice poster layouts .
in my field a peer reviewed article counts for a lot more than a chapter in an edited book .	like a lot of things in academia , i think this will heavily depend on what discipline you 're in .
for everything that have been reviewed and permanently archived then the bibliography is fine .	the best practice is to include standard bibliographic information , a relatively stable hypertext link for current readers ( e.g .
many universities have a unit devoted to providing support with grant applications .	if you are writing proposals for nsf consider volunteering as a reviewer in your discipline .
i agree with the other answer that this is a normal occurrence .	depending on which country you are talking about , there may be league tables for the universities in that country .
it is perfectly okay to ask for the figure knowing well that the other person may not give .	you can always ask , then it is the choice of the author to accept or not .
there are no services to help you get that coursework accredited .	most of the courses that i 've seen explicitly state that you obtain no credit for doing the course .
in my very personal opinion mdpi is an reputable publisher , but their journals are not first-class .	the peer review process generally differs between predatory and non predatory journals .
i think what you are asking can be carried out using web of science .	adding to gopi 's comment , here 's a snapshot of academic map at work .
aeismail 's answer points out two very important points : the deal-breakers and the pd purgatory .	actually , i think the frame of this question isn 't quite right .
the biggest problem with such repositories is that someone has to maintain them .	if you have access to it , you can very easily do that with thomson reuters ’ web of science portal .
in general , i believe , that graduate science education is not a good choice from a purely financial standpoint .	you didn 't mention if you want to do an ms in the uk or the us .
as you do more things , you can become more selective with what you list .	first of all : note that there is a difference between an academic cv and a resume .
i have one addendum to the great answers by f 'x pedro , and henry .	from your description , it sounds like the problem is more likely to have been the msc supervior than the student .
one thing that i haven 't seen mentioned yet is intellectual property rights .	whatever you are going to do after phd is your business .
the academic year does start around september in the usa and i think most european countries .	i would not accelerate things , to avoid getting worse grades that you want .
a book i would recommend is kosslyn 's graph design for the eye and mind .	the preeminent author on this topic is edward tufte , who wrote " the visual display of quantitative information " .
if you can re-take the gres without undue burden -- yes , re-take them .	many phd programs in computer science ( like my own ) don 't require gres ; read the application instructions carefully .
i will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for a !	you could defer admission , but it 's a little unusual to defer for a year .
http : / / www.glassdoor.com / works by getting anonymous information from users and sharing it .	i think this page has what you are looking for .
" all of the above " ... but maybe not wanting a book that started from a primer on linear algebra .	the answer can best be understood in terms of the intended goal of the researcher making the switch .
this is such a loaded question i 'm hesitant to answer .	like @ suresh says , in the us , i would expect that the advisor-advisee relationship would be separate from enrollment in the department .
at some universities , a post-doctoral fellow is a different title than a post-doctoral researcher due to federal regulations in the usa .	in addition to suresh 's answer , i 'd say that a postdoc is no longer a student .
for presentations , when you are using graphics from other papers , you refer to the paper .	there are two parts to this question : citation and copyright issues .
remember that europe is a big place , comprised of lots of different countries .	there are tough ( read respectable ) and relatively easy ( read weaker ) schools and phd programs in both sides .
here 's an answer based on my experience in the united states .	everywhere i 've attended and worked in britain , i 've called teachers by their first name and been called my first name .
a link to a profile page that makes it clear you 're a grad student should be enough .	personally i hate signatures , i see it as trying to make a superficial impression based on a title .
is there a way to measure my own reviewing bias ?	there aren ’ t many ways for your to evaluate how your reviews stand against others , but there is at least one .
i 'll tackle the easiest side of the question first : bringing nothing should not create trouble .	a gift to show your gratitude will always be appreciated .
applying to masters program does not really depend on one single factor but a variety of factors .	yes , the acknowledgements section of your paper is an appropriate place to thank anyone who provided valuable assistance .
i feel like pointing out that the very use of the word ' productivity ' reflects a certain kind of bias towards " quantity " .	there is no accepted numerical measure for an individual 's academic productivity .
pubmedcentral gives you full text and their api may be able to do it .	there seems to be no service or tool that let 's you download articles in bulk .
this recent nature news item would seem to suggest rather strongly that scirp is not a serious outfit .	yes , i do indeed have some direct experience with them .
i checked the peer review policy of nature and science , i guess that should is the best we can get .	well , as you said , there is no rule that explicitly says that the information mentioned in a “ invitation to review ” is confidential .
i don 't know how common it is , but certainly some institutions allow student papers .	have you tried asking your supervisor to deposit the papers ?
edit , again : the question seems to have changed , yet again .	i can think of three reasons why a faculty member might reveal how a student performed on a qualifying examination .
true story : a bottle of wine ( well , maybe just half a bottle ) .	second , i try to process 10 or so exams before actually marking any of them .
script only the introduction i can only echo what artem said about the disadvantages of a script .	i think a script is actually more harmful than good .
i agree with seteropere completely , " network science " is a very broad subject .	i would say you are approaching it in the wrong way .
i prefer to group definitions of notation and symbols with the typical " list of ... " elements .	email the work to someone ( or yourself ) well before you hand it over .
if you use bibtex , then you can batch edit with things like sed , awk , or simple find / replace in any text editor .	in my experience , the author syntax changes if you 're using doi or pmid .
i think the answer to your question is very dependent on your subject and the culture of that research area .	i agree that reference formatting for a thesis tends to follow university and discipline specific guidelines .
the first rule , as usual , is : what is expected of you ?	i always view " we " as " you and the reader " and you and your reader journey through the subject together .
i would say that it depends on the complexity you get out of it .	you should definitely consider publishing the algorithm , but not before you could say something more than merely a pseudocode .
how many publications or conference papers would you get out of this work ?	i 've known of a few cases of people prolonging their ph.ds to improve their cvs .
supporting an ideology in an ostentatious manner ( rather than privately or discreetly ) is a personality problem .	i think for an appropriate answer i 'd need to know exactly what the ' bad ' ideology is .
when asking a question , it is desirable to explicitly establish a non-confrontational tone .	my personal preference is not to offer a compliment in this setting .
i will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for a !	for questions 1 and 2 : it depends : you have to find out from your individual advisor / department / university .
if there 's a medical reason for it and the student can produce an appropriate doctor 's certificate or what not .	you will definitely need to check regulations regarding the wearing of costumes that conceal one 's appearance .
this does not fully answer your question , but it is certainly one consideration .	i am a phd student in computational science , which is an interdisciplinary major spanning mathematics , computer science , and engineerning .
tv-l is the german public servant remuneration grade table ( tarifvertrag für den öffentlichen dienst der länder ( tv-l ) ) .	i am sure a psychologist could provide an indepth analysis to a large part of this question .
nobody cares about your university , the only important thing at least in europe is your cv .	does doing a postdoc mean a commitment to an academic career ?
the biggest obstacle is that you haven 't been through a ph.d. program .	it can be very difficult to get government financing depending on where you reside .
a few possible problems : 1 ) such an id system seems a little intrusive .	in mathematics , we already have a database of this sort - two them , in fact , with in mathscinet and zentralblatt math .
short answer : the full name is izvestiya akademii nauk sssr , tekhnicheskaya kibernetika .	as others have said , not every ( old ) article has a doi or a url .
in your case , how do you find 14 good leaders from 70 students ?	my armchair researching dug up a lot of articles about this .
it depends on whether the black hole is rotating or not .	it 's complicated , and it depends on what you mean by " black hole " .
as an complement to the other answers , let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking .	the other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense .
stars are rotating , but that 's not the cause for their stability .	stars rotate due to the angular momentum of the gas they formed from .
of course the apparent relative sizes of the sun and moon are coincidental .	as a matter of fact , yes , it is only a coincidence .
it indeed appears the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) and the milky way ( mw ) are en route to a collision .	in a few billion years , the milky way and andromeda will collide .
stellar mass black holes form from the collapse of massive stars at the end of their lives .	stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes likely form from very different mechanisms .
the metal content of the solar system is completely dominated by the sun .	the metals that are forming in the sun come from nuclear fusion .
the short answer is : we are made from the " stuff " contributed by many stars .	it is highly unlikely that we 're made out of stuff from only one star .
all we know is this : distant objects are receding from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us .	the expansion of space means that objects in cosmological distances are receding away from each other .
when you sit in a car , and you suddenly brake , you feel the change in velocity .	if you 're big enough and fluid enough , like an atmosphere , you would feel acceleration do to the earth 's motion .
there is no ' still ' that is not relative to some other object .	the so called expansion of the universe is not as trivial as most people think .
like chris said above , stars rotate to conserve their angular momentum .	stars are rotating , but that 's not the cause for their stability .
the light will eventually reach galaxy b even though the space between them is expanding .	to answer your question : the speed of light is relative to the metric of the space itself .
according to this website the peak visible magnitude will be about 10.5 around february 2nd .	the aavso data seems to indicate that it might have already peaked , at around 10.5 ( visual ) .
all of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle .	i will be specific to answering the part regarding the prediction of solar flares .
dark matter , is just a name for something we know nothing of .	light may account for a small portion of dark matter , but it is unlikely to account for most / all of it .
compared to the planets the moon changes it 's rise and set times very quickly .	the moon didn 't abruptly change position , it is gradually and continually changing position .
we are moving " ... relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame ... at some 371 km / s towards the constellation leo " .	there is no ' still ' that is not relative to some other object .
yes , it 's true that the apparent size of the moon is 30 arcmin .	when you gaze at the moon " live " , you are not seeing a still image .
let us assume the data for a globular cluster to be equivalent to that of m13 .	globular clusters occupy an interesting place in the spectrum of composite stellar systems .
you 'll probably need spectrometer data to distinguish and identify spectral lines .	no , amateur astronomy equipment is not capable of doing such an analysis .
to complete envite 's answer , i would point that you can easily experience that irregularity yourself .	any body with an irregular mass distribution will experience those wobblings .
4 billion years is the same timeframe of the life remaining to our sun .	normally when two galaxies collide , it is the gas that interacts with each other .
the outer shell of the star contains still a lot of hydrogen , after running out of fuel .	if something crashed into it rearranging its content a bit , could its life be extended ?
why is the speed of light 299,792,458 m / s , and not ( for instance ) 3,1 or 4,3 x 10 ^ 44 m / s ?	speed of light being finite is one of the fundamentals of our universe .
molten iron and hot sand - it 's not easy to think of something more extreme than this .	so far , we don 't have anywhere near enough detail to identify weather on planets in other star systems .
what you 're asking , basically , is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the solar system .	according to newton , any binary system revolves around the center of mass .
it very much depends on where on the globe you are in terms of your latitude .	to add to tidalwave 's answer , here 's another way to think about it .
only a very small fraction of the elements in the core the supernova get converted into heavier elements .	for a star to become a nova , it needs to have a mass at least 8 times greater than our sun .
as per your definition , a star formed in a binary system ( hence near some gravitating body ) is a generalised planet .	the main flaw with your definition of a " generalised planet " would be the boundary between stars and planets .
one additional source of evidence comes from other spiral galaxies .	in addition to @ mbr 's answer ; there are other ( less confusing ) ways to represent the data .
what you 're asking , basically , is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the solar system .	a black hole has an event horizon which ' marks the point of no return ' .
naively , i would say that you 're looking for a periodicity in the luminosity .	any body with an irregular mass distribution will experience those wobblings .
the energy density of the universe is quite well known .	no energy is in transit as grbs , just like gamma rays that started in a grb .
even though i 'm a professional astronomer ( but not an expert on this field ) , i don 't have a good answer .	i can 't give you an explicit ant mathematical explanation but maybe this simulations give you a hint .
light may account for a small portion of dark matter , but it is unlikely to account for most / all of it .	in addition to @ mbr 's answer ; there are other ( less confusing ) ways to represent the data .
the mass luminosity relation is non-linear ( l = m ^ 3.5 for the main sequence ) so more massive stars burn at a much faster rate .	the easiest way to think of it is terms of the cube square law coming into play .
well , when two black holes collide a new black hole is created .	there are currently three classifications of black hole and these are stellar , super massive and miniature .
there is a prior answer here claiming that " a moon with a moon would be an unstable system " .	i don 't think there are any in the solar system .
as far as i know all accretion disks are prograde .	consider a binary system with a neutron star and a companion star .
from 1979 to 1999 , pluto was the eighth planet from the sun .	no , pluto is a so called resonant trans-neptunian object ; the orbital period of pluto is almost exactly 3 : 2 ( 1.5 ) times that of neptune .
a method used to calculate the distance between stars is 3 dimensional trigonometry .	you only need two-dimensional trigonometry if you know the distances to the two stars and their angular separation .
the light will eventually reach galaxy b even though the space between them is expanding .	to any observer between ' a ' and ' b ' where the light wave passes , it passes with the speed of light .
like afzaal ahmad said black holes evaporate through hawking radiation , proposed by stephen hawking in 1974 .	yes , everything that is in this universe has to say good bye to its existence .
you 're experiencing a few issues all of which have one solution .	regarding the fact of using the scope indoors : it 's understandable , but silly .
space , as we experience it , is simply three-dimensional euklidean ( flat ) space .	particle like , molecule or atoms or any smallest particle behaves differently in different environment .
stars can form in circumstellar disks , that are , in general , disks surrounding forming stars , but not in protoplanetary disks .	yes , unless you want to get really particular with the " protoplanetary " part .
the farther away , the faster the galaxies move away from us .	here is my answer to a similar question posted on the physics stack exchange website .
the programs i am aware of that you could use do require some programming expertise to operate .	yes , there is are two python modules called astropy , and astropysics that both claim to have spectral analysis tools .
main difference ( beyond mass , which we can extrapolate to make giant clusters and small galaxies touch ) is star age .	there are a couple of important distinctions between the two types of objects .
no , the orbiting rocket was not visible to the naked eye .	in the protostar stage of the sun , it was surrounded by a ( spinning ) gas cloud .
from a ( more ) physics standpoint our acceleration on earth is basically zero from what we can feel .	when you sit in a car , and you suddenly brake , you feel the change in velocity .
after all these astronomic answers , i will add a computer one .	yes , it 's true that the apparent size of the moon is 30 arcmin .
i think you mean to ask , " what is the local sidereal time of greenwhich ? " .	right ascension is a celestial coordinate , not a terrestrial one .
i believe your confusion is from combining two popular simplifications of our universe .	the surface of the 4-dimensional ball ( called 3-sphere ) is a slice through the universe as a whole for a fixed cosmic time .
yes , we always look into the past , when looking somewhere .	i think the question is referring to situating a very large mirror in space facing earth .
this is one of the great remaining mysteries of the universe .	in these quantum theories , forces are mediated by particles called gauge bosons .
yes , binary comets do exist ; 8p / tuttle is an example of one .	if the closing velocity is very low , the energy can be dissipated by the comets squishing .
no - distances between objects get larger , but galaxies and clusters are dominated locally by gravity .	ummm this question made me think about a lecture from my teacher .
nickel plating can improve the surface , but it 's not easy in detail : paper on nickel plating .	the aluminum oxide layer forms as soon as oxygen comes in contact with the mirror surface .
the colorful patterns of gas are caused by excitation of gas atoms , e.g .	you might be interested in these two answers : how dense are nebulae ?
this has not been answered yet for sure i guess .	you are making the mistake of thinking that there was a single spot in space that everything expanded from .
there are a few more elements which you might consider .	the tail particles from a comet are ejected , so they have a distinct velocity than that of the comet .
gravitational lensing is the effect that large amounts of gravity have on the path of light .	one star passes in front of another from our perspective .
pluto : it was disqualified as a planet because orbital dominance was not achieved in the case of pluto .	disclaimer : most of what is written here is based highly on theory and speculation .
no , not all total lunar eclipses will turn the moon deep red .	the redness of the moon is due to earth 's atmosphere refraction of sun rays and pollution - dust particles etc .
what i mean to say is , how are the characteristics of event horizon related to space-time ?	depends on how the angular momentum ( that manifests itself as earth 's rotation ) would be absorbed .
in addition to undo 's fine answer , i would like to explain a bit about the motivation behind the definition .	the correct answer is 8 ( mercury , venus , earth , mars , jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptune ) .
charon and pluto are tidally locked , as is the moon to the earth .	it would require a very precise trajectory for an asteroid to end up in geostationary orbit .
stars form in star-formation regions , which itself develop from molecular clouds .	it may be possible for a solar system like ours to exist outside of a galaxy .
if so by how much does it " spoil " the view of stars and galaxies etc .	it does not act as a solid lens , because it does not have a limit surface .
well , kepler has explained that 2 randomly moving objects , attracted towards each other , will always form elliptical orbits .	when an object is in orbit , there are two factors at play , not just one .
dark matter , is just a name for something we know nothing of .	as yashbhatt said , we can detect light : with our eyes ( visible light only ) and with special machines .
a black hole ( briefly ) , is nothing more than a dead star whose mass was more than 3 solar masses .	i think you mean to ask , " what is the local sidereal time of greenwhich ? " .
i 'm not sure i understand your question entirely , but i 'll do my best to offer a decent answer .	no , it is not since jupiter is not a star .
astronomers use this system simply because it is ( was ) convenient .	in order to know when a star will be above horizon , you 'll need an equation with times , not " celestial latitudes " .
in the upper photosphere , the electrons join with the ions to neutralize the atom .	emission and absorption lines are due to kirchhoff 's laws that explain what happens when light passes through a gas .
over the past 150 years , telescope technology has improved immensely , so we can now see much further than in the past .	there are a couple of different horizons you should care about .
temperature ( $ t _ { eff } $ ) can be quite tricky to determine accurately as it interrelates to a number of other fundamental measurements .	the star reaches a critical mass and ignites , blowing away the surrounding material .
we have not discovered every galaxy in existence , nor have we watched each to see how it is spinning .	rotation : one of the easiest way to show that galaxies rotates are doppler observations of atomic or molecular lines .
asphalt roads do a great job at heating up cities !	actually this is one of the possible ways we have in order to make mars friendlier to humans .
it appears that way because there is more land reflecting sun light to your retina at the edges .	in the image you are now refering to the only significant brightness difference is between the mare and the " highlands " .
molten iron and hot sand - it 's not easy to think of something more extreme than this .	i would say on the gas giants : jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune .
yes , but it does not stay in the same constellation .	constellations are human constructs to make sense of the night sky .
there are a few incorrect assumptions in your post , so it is difficult to answer as asked .	we do have 2 summers and two winters - and 2 springs and autumns too .
it depends on what you plan on using it for .	there is one rule that is generally true for all deep sky objects ( nebulae , stars , galaxies , ... ) : aperture matters !
yes , the equinox will drift over time , but the seasons will not invert every 13000 years .	dates are set by progress through the currently used calendar .
asteroids are what are called minor planets - small inner solar system rocky bodies .	the objects you are refering to are actually two different objects : asteroids and comets .
the objects in a galaxy orbit it 's center as a planet does with it 's star , they keep the same distance .	density waves cause the build up of galactic material in to spiral arms .
yes , stacking barlow lenses is a common practice to effectively increase focal length by multiplying their individual focal lengths .	kepler did know the orbital period of the earth , mars , venus , mercury , jupiter , and saturn .
it turned out to be not real grb event , just a false alarm .	the caption for the graph in the article linked says " raw data " .
the simple answer is yes , because magnetic fields extend to infinity .	you seriously cannot expect the sun to have a layer that would contain some of its harmful radiation .
it may be specified from south westwards ( 0 ° to 360 ° ) , or from north eastwards and westwards ( 180 ° to -180 ° ) .	azimuth is conventionally calculated as a degree value between 0 ( inclusive ) and 360 ( exclusive ) .
the answers provided to this question so far seem to be good .	you could confirm with taking an image of the star trails .
short answer : we won 't have to worry about the galactic empire any time soon .	as the definition says , a typeiii civilization does change the energy of the galaxy .
as yashbhatt said , we can detect light : with our eyes ( visible light only ) and with special machines .	light may account for a small portion of dark matter , but it is unlikely to account for most / all of it .
the composition of an exoplanet is what is being referred to when someone calls it earth-like .	the earth similarity index ( esi ) is a weighted geometric mean of four similarities .
black holes can evaporate through a quantum process known as hawking radiation and that 's it .	as far as we know there is nothing that can stop a black hole .

do you live in any sort of shared or communal housing ( such as a college dorm ) ?	miernik , you say the only cohabitant in your room is mold ?
i feel your pain - i absolutely pour with sweat with any vigorous exercise , even in cool conditions .	sweat rate is sweat rate , you can 't really control it .

i think this question presumes far to much determinism on the part of the " great purge " process .	apart from advocating scientific management , gastev was a proletariat smithy ( kuznitsa ) poet .
you can get a breakdown of the major causes of death here .	bruce catton 's history and shelby foote 's history should have the details .
for mongols specifically , it was in part their unparallelled-till-20th-century tactical flexibility .	you might also ask why these people from the steppes also created so much havoc in china .
encouraged by the kind words about my comment , i have turned it into an answer with more details and sources .	the truth is that germany ways de-facto the leader in the majority of sciences from the end of xix century .
here are some rough specs for common planes ( as i said in the comment , the endurance depends on various factors ) .	all depends on the aircraft , development went very quickly during ww1 .
yes , su did its best to make sure that its satellites were controlled as tightly as possible .	this is unfortunately the only source i could find which describes comecon 's imperialist tendencies in great detail .
dominus , plural domini , in ancient rome , “ master , ” or “ owner , ” particularly of slaves .	a greek-speaking slave ( δούλος , doulos ) i think would call his master κύριος ( translit : kurios ; lord , master , sir ; vocative form : κύριε ) .
every 1000 years or so you can expect a large " 1000-year-flood " near large rivers .	i think the question totally glosses over the fact that " east pakistan " was created out of the partition of bengal .
germany was fortunate to have a large batch of officers born in the 1890s .	to my impression this reflects systematic bias of the sources you use , possibly , sources circulating in your country and / or language .
the bulk of india then was not controlled by porus , but by the nanda dynasty , centered at pataliputra .	i believe alexander lost heart after his horse , bucephelus , died from a wound received in the battle against porus .
i agree with the new world statement , classes are something inherited from kingships , like the nobility is the highest class .	even if somebody can rise to height , does not make a society classless .
song of solomon ( as you mentioned in your comments ) does have some erotic contents .	romance is hardly a western construct ; it 's universal among all humans .
the soviet union 's invasion of afghanistan in the late 20th century has its roots in the " great game " of the 19th century .	i think everyone who has posted here ( @ ihtkwot , @ mgb , @ russell ) have all brought up important points .
there is evidence of english longbows shooting farther than 250 yards , particularly at crecy , where the longer bowshots were around 300 yards .	too many factors at work to really say ' a bow has a range of x ' .
it did exist but no one is sure what it was .	it was pitch / tar and oil that was ignited and sprayed if my memory serves me correctly .
yes , this is true and yes , in most cases indefinite articles indeed developed from numerals , as @ mgn already said .	indefinite articles developed from numerals , and the definite articles developed from demonstratives .
the hawaiian language has seen a big revival in the past 20-30 years .	sanskrit has been a subject of revival efforts since the 1908s in various villages in india .
i 'll also throw in that some languages also have grammatical gender in their verbs .	romance languages have ( generally speaking ) three classes of verbs , inherited from latin .
preserving grammaticality and preserving meaning of the sentence are two different things .	in fact , you can remove pretty much and preserve grammaticality if you don 't care about preserving meaning .
let 's say that a future participle is a non-finite form of a verb which is marked for future tense .	latin forms the future participle of most verbs ( futurus , moriturus ) , russian only form the verb to be ( будущий ) .
in some nowadays indo-european languages you can still see rests of base-20 numeral systems .	modern englishes , and many other well-known languages , use base 10 ( ie decimal ) systems of numerals .
just to add this : what is usually called hebrew script was in fact borrowed from aramaic .	the source for this is in a book called the coming revolution by zamir cohen .
i 'm going to answer about just the words for " pineapple " .	@ joe has covered words for " pineapple " , so here 's some info on words for " banana " .
only to the degree that all slavic languages are somewhat mutually intelligible .	bluntly , slovak and slovenian have nothing in common other than being both slavic languages .
language can " improve " over time as well as " just changing " .	" are modern languages in any non-arbitrary way superior to ancient languages , e.g .
well there aren 't phonemes in signed languages because phonemes are specifically sounds .	historically , signed phonemes were considered to fall into 4 ( or 5 depending on who you ask ) categories that are sometimes called parameters .
the classical , pure versions of mesoamerican languages used for the most part a base-20 system .	modern englishes , and many other well-known languages , use base 10 ( ie decimal ) systems of numerals .
no , this is not the only example of a language that was developed de novo .	there is also the al-sayyid bedouin sign language , which developed under similar circumstances ( isolated deaf community ) in the south of israel .
partially , it depends on how you think of what the goal of linguistics is .	broadly speaking , there is a linguistic continuum across northern india .
i disagree partly with this answer claiming that ' aa ' and ' ağ ' are identical .	i am a native turkish speaker living in i̇stanbul , 30 years old .
i have not heard of a language that lacks numbers entirely , and doubt one exists ( happy to see proof though ) .	would you count a language that has lost most of its ( original ) number system ?
as many pointed out , ' free word order ' is a complete misnomer .	thank you all for giving examples of word order in your mother language .
the difficulty arises not from the various linguistic properties of the language pair as many here suggest .	it depends on generally syntactic structure of two languages and -yes- some pragmatic issues .
the question can be explored in terms of n-ellipsis ( noun ellipsis , also known as np-ellipsis ) .	i agree with thomas that the situation in english and in german is not the same .
regarding romanian 's history : it 's a member of the eastern romance ( sensu strictu ) subfamily or the " vlach " languages .	one possibility is because of its relative isolation from the other latin-based languages .
matt davis provides a useful summary related to this meme .	i couldn 't read the first and not the second much either .
to begin with , the chinese phoneme is not exactly sh but it sounds more like k in swedish käften .	this word can well be connected with its chinese counterpart .
that 's actually a diagnostic test for what is a " proper noun " in english-- it resists taking an article .	i 'm not an expert , but in my experience this is common in galician and spanish .
the picture of the synthesis degree is not very clear in many languages .	for those unsure of terminology , " analytic " refers to how many morphemes group together to make a word .
i say option d. when in doubt , you can try what web browsers do .	tl ; dr : option d is the answer , and option e may be an answer with minor corrections .
there are curious adjunct uses of " of-phrases " as in " a man of honor " , which correspond to the latin genitive of description .	here are some cases where an adjunct ( always locative ) comes before the " of " complement .
what the hearer perceives must clearly be called a phoneme .	i am not sure if there is a word for no .
is your question about an analysis or about automated parsing ?	as ivan writes , the example in the question is indeed an example of so-called right node raising ( rnr ) .
remember that the intersection of the outputs of two context-free languages is not necessarily context free .	weak context-freeness : can the language be analyzed by a cf grammar at all ?
in english , certainly the most common use of do is do-support .	in traditional grammar , the word doing is a participle in all your examples .
a caveat : i 'm experiencing the tail end of a three day migraine .	i agree with the commentators that your question is a little confusing .
a long time ago , languagetool used to be usable with just openoffice .	you may want to have a look at opennlp http : / / opennlp.apache.org / .
this issue is discussed in some detail in this paper by the late , great linguist larry trask .	although it is a strong tendency it is still only a tendency .
the reason for this is that russian is a much more tonal language than english .	although i am quite fluent in russian , i wouldn 't say english sound particularly ' cold ' to me .
palatalisation of / k / before front vowels happens all over the place : russian , greek , turkish , persian etc .	sinhala , one of the languages spoken in sri lanka has a four way deixis system .
all the same methods of analysis that are used with spoken languages apply successfully to signed languages .	one idea that 's been going around at least since the 80s is that you can distinguish between holds and moves .
newspeak , a " deliberately impoverished " language designed to prevent people from communicating and thinking about subversive ideas .	every language is permeated by the cultural values in which it is immersed .
the dirty little secret of english is that syllable boundaries mostly do not matter ( unlike other languages ) .	unfortunately , there is no straightforward syllabification method that is accepted by a majority of linguists .
well since your question contains nothing to compare to and is therefore ambiguous , the answer could only be yes .	the more languages you know , the easier it generally is to learn new ones .
contrary to some of the other answerers , i do think " intuition blurring " is a real thing .	languages can often be distinguished based on prosodic information alone .
perhaps you could start by studying how you pronounce english / w / , which consists of simultaneous labial and velar approximation .	try looking in a mirror into your mouth while producing some words like " fill feel hello ladle larry bottle etc " .
in russian , for example , animacy is not clear-cut in the distinction animate / inanimate .	as in russian , polish marks animate masculine nouns by having a genitive-accusative vs. the nominative-accusative of inanimate masculines .
as you can see from this map on the wals.info site , there are many .	this is an example i always find is helpful for first year .
one interesting source of information comes from what old prescriptive grammarians found to gripe about .	no , it doesn 't make sense for exactly the reasons you posited .
if you want a very quick and simple program to slow down a sound file of speech , use vlc player .	free software , ' audacity ' , can apply and preserve , as well as infinitely undo , many useful transformations in any selections of the audio .
there 's a lot of types of signed languages ( some more like sign vocabularies ) , so not all have the same properties .	the biggest problem with signing is that you can 't talk to a person without first getting their attention .
sounds like you have a great idea for developing linguistics software !	to some extent , there are rules you can apply to pronounce , say , teaching based on the known pronunciation of teach .
with some help from rocío , i have found a fairly useful resource ( in the bibliography of greenberg ) .	when writing my dissertation about language and identity i found these two references : bugarski , r. ( 1997 ) .
it sounds like what you are really looking for is linguistic evidence of a semitic substrate in old english .	the balkan sprachbund is a group of languages which have interspersed grammatical features among each other .
another example of the same combination of gnarly syllable structure and tone is tlingit , where words like [ tʃχánkʼ ] ‘ grandkid ’ and [ ɬʔùɬ.tʃí.nì ] ‘ vest ’ occur .	i think that the basic observation about agglutinative languages generally not having complex tonal systems is pretty well upheld .
it actually has nothing to do with a phonological rule , per se .	i doubt the explanations given elsewhere in this thread very much .
english spelling did deteriorate , due to almost abruptive historical changes .	language can " improve " over time as well as " just changing " .
it is , however , main-stream indo-europeanist theory that the suffix * -es marks both the genitive singular and the nominative plural m / f in proto-indo-european .	there is a paper by pavel caha on lingbuzz that addresses this exact question .
zipf ’ s law , as i understand it , is not really about languages , but about statistics and probability .	as with all natural laws , zipf 's law is an approximation .
palatalisation of / k / before front vowels happens all over the place : russian , greek , turkish , persian etc .	the same goes for [ g ] : [ ǵ ] and [ l ] : [ ĺ ] , and no other consonant .
i may be missing something but isn 't this more a question of negation scope .	i do not know that i have a proper answer , but i would like to summarize my findings .
i think there is a need for a comprehensive review of the origins of the features of indian linguistic area .	i wouldn 't hundred percent subscribe to tamil ( refering here to classical tamil sangam poetry ) being mora-timed .
in speech , of course , rhythm and intonation would probably make it clear what the speaker meant .	i have probably turned myself into a machine , but the sentences i was driving against the traffic towards london .
if you want to go in depth , check the links .	there are formalized dependency-based grammars , such as meaning-text theory or functional generative description .
the modern moscow school asserts that pie was predated by proto-eurasiatic .	the answer is that we do not know ( and possibly never will ) .
i agree completely with the comment by @ alenanno , jun 29 at 15 : 07 .	although i am quite fluent in russian , i wouldn 't say english sound particularly ' cold ' to me .
the example of piraha shows that chomsky 's basic claim about language is incorrect , and that 's it .	a sort of squabble played out a few years ago on the pages of language .
there is at least one case i can think of in english similar to this .	latin has a pretty large class of nouns like these , which are actually called abundantia in the grammatical tradition .
one powerful husband and wife couple had created an organization before interlingua was formalized .	first of all , this goal is seen as somewhat utopic today .
the japanese case marker = ga ( a post-clitic ) , was not originally a subject marker .	first , i am going to address tangurena 's answer ( i don 't have enough reputation to add a comment ) .
wikipedia 's page on lenition seems to suggest that a / t / - > / θ / change can actually come from a / t / - > / tθ / ( affrication ) - > / θ / ( spiratization ) change .	i would really give not an answer but somewhat refusal for the question ( despite the question is really good ) .
most english words have roots in indo-european , either through original germanic or through borrowed latin , french , or greek words .	as you can probably guess , there are several ways to determine the etymology of words .
i 'm afraid this is wishful thinking on the part of some instructor .	as others have pointed out , it seems that you probably meant to discuss homo * phones * , and i 'll proceed on that assumption .
in witness for the defense , elizabeth loftus describes how police questioning can influence witnesses into recalling events that never happened .	the most interesting research is experimental work on grammatical gender and functional words ( like prepositions ) .
what those " childish errors " really show are that children are generating language , not just repeating it .	with due regard to @ mollyocr 's answer , i shall answer my own question .
a part of the question thusfar unattended is whether the concept of phoneme has always been contentious .	" phoneme " is a theoretical construct which probably can 't go away .
you should clarify the question a bit to make sure you mean ' writing systems ' , not languages .	in the old ethiopic language ge 'ez a double dot ( : ) was used to separate words .
if you arecomming from the non-linguistics environment , the best book is to start with is fromkin , introduction to language .	this is what they recommend at oxford as introductory textbooks to students starting a masters ' in linguistics .
my estimation would be between 1000 and 500 years ago , after population drifts but before the european conquest .	one problem is , as you 've identified , how to define " language " .
from what i 'm seeing it 's generally accepted that most english speakers have a vocabulary size of 15000 to 20000 words .	according to a statistical estimation i know roughly 7000 words in english .
" not fast " is in arabic ليست سريعة ( pronounced something like " lessat sahirah " ) .	in fact , it seems to be the case that you do get / r / in those contexts and specific words ( also , ' squash ' , etc . ) .
a quick search of جید on google returned two relevant results .	what roots cannot denote is the actual and specific performance of an action .
-er a derivational suffix because it changes the word class to which the entire expression belongs .	i am not convinced that either one of these answers in correct .
it seems you don 't understand the difference between morphology and phonology and therefore , the difference between morphemes and phonemes .	'orthographically similar ' might be another term you can use , meaning ' spelled similarly ' .
this answer does not address the source of the vietnamese word , just the vietnamese / lao connection .	different languages produce their vowels at different positions in the mouth .
according to this wals page " passive constructions " , there are five necessary properties of a passive construction .	you may want to start with an excellent review by leonid kulikov .
what could really be hardly translated into russian is ' privacy ' ( although some might disagree stating that it is translated as покой ) .	the western desert language in australia does not have a word directly equivalent to english ' love ' .
in traditional principles and parameters framework 1 , noun phrases ( np ) are considered the topmost lexical head .	these are two different representations that depend on your assumption .
the farsi word " جادو " / dʒɒ : du : / is thought to be cognate with sanskrit " यातु " / ja : tu / , with a similar meaning .	avestan yātu- , middle persian jādūg , new persian jādū all mean “ sorcerer ” , though the np word is also used for “ sorcery ” ( mp .
passenger : how long will the bus stay at the station ?	this kind of phonological ambiguity is frequent enough , also because sound may be distorted .
latin semen comes from sero , " to sow " , which in turn comes from the proto-indo-european * sē ( i ) - , " to sow " .	hebrew šɛmɛn שמן “ oil , fat ” is a semitic cognate of arabic samn سمن “ fat , butter ” ( with semitic s1 ) .
you are right - it is the vibration of the vocal cord that adds " voice " .	normally , english " k " , " t " and " p " are always aspirated , so they have a very slight " h " sound right after them .
british popular singers do tend to sound american -- but obviously not the choristers at king 's college !	i think the academic phonological analysis is true only to a small extent .
it was too long for the comment , so had to post it as an answer .	@ alenanno 's answer is great , but there is yet another factor : conspiracy .
jane , i disagree on two points : hebrew wasn ’ t ( morphologically ) simplified because of european jews ; it was mainly syntactically europeanised .	interesting response from ron maimon , although i am not sure i understand it fully .
i can think of two main factors which would motivate such a decision .	this is not a scientific account , it may not be accurate , nor am i an expert on the subject .
as pointed out by others , " true synonyms " do not exist .	i think the word you are looking for is plesionym .
i 'm not aware of any publication which has exact percentages for the origins of monguor vocabulary .	re : " some of mongour are taoist and bonan are muslim " the bao 'an / bonan who are officially classified as such live in gansu .
at least , in night the " t " came from the original pie word for night , noqu ̯ ts .	this kind of phonological ambiguity is frequent enough , also because sound may be distorted .
things like the swadesh list are an attempt at a vocabulary list along the lines you are talking about .	i just read about a study on this which used a fascinating methodology .
in french , all the words are the same if they refer to the same animal or product .	here is a funny clip from a dramatization of a japanese class : nihonjin no shiranai nihongo episode 1 clips .
let me give you a maths example : pentagon , hexagon , heptagon , octagon , nonagon , decagon ， ? ?	the op seems to be bilingual in english in chinese .
to decide if a language is related to another language requires showing that they descend from a common ancestor .	at present , the recent findings of lusitanian inscriptions confirm the bilingual character ( indigenous - latin ) of the so called lusitanian language .
there 's actually been a lot of work on this kind of issue in morphosyntax .	i don 't see why a definite article suffix and " definiteness " as a noun property contradict each other .
in medieval christian theology , things that were left-handed were things that belonged to satan ( or were corrupted by him ) .	the english word " right " comes from proto-indo-european word o ̯ reĝtos which meant " correct " and had cognates o ̯ reĝr " directive , order " , o ̯ reĝs " king , ruler " , o ̯ reĝti " guides , directs " , o ̯ reĝi ̯ om " kingdom " .
i have a pair with the big-toe strap , and they 're very comfortable when i wear them with toe socks .	i have gone through three pairs , two without the toe strap , and one with .
a tent may give you slightly more protection than sleeping out in the open , but not much .	no , a tent will not give you any protection from bears that want what 's inside .
although i agree with am _ hawk as down being both light and compressible , i 'd also suggest layering your clothing .	down is the lightest and most compressible delivering the best warmth .
a few points to add here : coyotes are not know to be aggressive towards humans .	in general they are not considered dangerous because they rarely attack humans .
in case you don 't have anything to put on your bites , i found out the following .	i use solarcaine , which contains a local anesthetic , on both mosquito bites and sunburn .
in case of ascending on a rockface it does not really matter which way round you use it .	i always ascend the other way around ( foot-prusik above the chest prusik ) .
as mentioned in other answers , it will depend on the type of your backpack .	i have gone through three pairs , two without the toe strap , and one with .
bear spray is a more humane option ; however , you do ask about legal repercussions .	you can shoot a human in self defense , so don 't worry about shooting a bear if you have to .
we use a padded bag that goes around the waist like the dreaded fanny pack .	i 've been using a lowepro tlz bag clipped to the front of my pack , just above the sternum straps .

nylon dries fast , is resistant to ripping and tearing , and fairly breathable .	nylon , among other synthetics , is an ideal material for clothing for most outdoor pursuits for several reasons .
the band actually works like a taut line hitch knot .	the simplest ones are like this , and even the more complex ones are typically broadly similar .
gps ( wikipedia ) is based on orbiting satellites and so is accurate worldwide .	gps systems can , and do , work everywhere you can get satellites .
the simple solution is not to rub your arms against your torso .	there is a product called naked surf that you can apply as a liquid rash guard .
to actually load a person onto a boat , try a parbuckle .	if there is another person person onboard , have them do nothing but watch the person in the water .
the main reason it 's buried is to keep it from washing into water supplies .	actually it 's looking like bio-charing the waste is going to be the best option .
warmth -- this is after all why you are buying the bag .	the key factors are going to vary from person to person .
different parts of california have different wildlife , so you should probably narrow the region .	american black bears they are somewhat common in some wilderness areas of california , mostly in the mountains .
so it 's important to have a basic understanding before you even get on skis .	skiing is a sport where taking lessons pays off very quickly .
i would consider using osm as they are available for garmin devices .	i 'm going to say that fit is one of the most important elements .
i follow a paleotic diet ( which is gluten-free ) for fairly similar reasons .	first , sorry to hear the diagnosis , but you are not alone .
so there is a known reason for the order not to drink tap water .	if you are being asked to boil water it has a biological contamination .
as i noted in my answer to that question , plasticene or stress balls work .	whilst walking about , clench your fist , then stretch your hand open again .
my favorite fireside activity is my family 's version of 20 questions .	i think kate gregory 's answer has covered the most important issues .
you may have luck with a thermos flask , or similar insulated flask above a regular water bottle .	i use a " camelbak stoaway " bladder - it has a bit of insulation and neoprene on the tube .
what i do is wrap the duct tape around a pencil .	duct tape wraps around items fairly and can be stored by wrapping on your gear .
if you drop a belay plate you can use a munter hitch to descend down the rope .	one method is to build a brake out of carabiners .
icebug specializes in shoes made for running on ice or other very slippery surfaces .	as stated by graham in his comment , i would recommend using ice traction device like this one or this one .
you need to have clothes for the coldest part of the trip , at the mountaintop .	when hiking in the cold you need to be able to sweat but not get cold .
in a gym , the toprope will be wrapped over a cylindrical bar .	alright , there are several different issues here that we must be sure to address .
glucosamine is for cartilage , and finger pain from climbing is probably tendon problems .	i 've had a very large number of finger and tendon injuries over 20 years of climbing .
i visit az every summer and include some hikes in the desert when i 'm there .	apart from what has been said , your need of water also depends on what you eat .
the obvious thing to consider would be how loud the whistle is .	pea vs. pealess -- in very cold temperatures , pea whistles don 't work volumn -- louder is better ... to a point .
a wonderful woman i know has the habenera bag by rei ( link ) .	if you can settle on purple nunatak and feather friends have good sleeping bags in those colors .
cross-loading with certain belay devices - take a look at the rhino carabiner which is specially constructed to prevent cross loading .	keeping some outward tension on the belay device really helps .
a few others i could think of : foxes foxes are generally not aggressive are easily scared away by humans .	in the uk we have , comparative to other countries , very few venomous creatures .
we 've camped for a month ( 4 adults / no kids ) , no tv , no phone , no radio or power & one water spigot .	tie the end of the yarn to the bottom-most thread of the warp .
there are several factors you should considering when judging the severity of a fall .	perhaps manufacturers advise on how much strain their ropes could take before retirement ?

first off , let me admit , i have never made crack-climbing gloves with tape .	to me , hiking is totally different from the rest of the activities on the list .
i wouldn 't say it 's necessarily better for the things you outline than the other common options .	i would since a tampon has more than one use example this link shows 10 different ways to use one ( http : / / artofmanliness.com / 2012 / 06 / 05 / survival-tampon / ) .
for hard-packed or icy snow , steel runner sleds are quite fast .	we have tested many sleds over the years and this one is as dangerously fast as it is classically beautiful .
if you haven 't climbed in a while i would recommend staying away from doing fingertip pull-ups on hang boards .	climbing is the best exercise for finger and hand strength improvement , just make sure to warm up and stretch .
on more than one occasion , having forgotten deet , we have just rubbed down with raw garlic .	i 've heard good things about badger balm protecting from biting bugs .
although technology has brought us many conveniences most of them require supporting power or other technology .	the first solution that comes to mind is a " zeer " , or pot-in-pot refrigerator .

perhaps she will respond to the sound ( or smell , if applicable ) of treats .	okay , so you 've got a dog running around without a leash and one that won 't let you catch him ?
i don 't have direct experience with bettas , but i 've never heard that pairs will work long-term in any male / female combination .	bettas are highly territorial and no matter what sexes you keep together they will fight .
cats are sensitive and highly strung , and can sometimes have odd reactions to being over-stimulated .	i think what you 're encountering is called feline hyperesthesia syndrome but the common name is rolling skin disease .
since the risks and pitfalls of wire floors are largely mentioned , i 'll mention pros ...	regardless of floor choice , remember that they need a burrow-like " safe " area to cope with stress .
we always put it crushed up in a bit of butter or on a sardine .	we had a cat that required daily medication , and it was a struggle to give the cat a pill .
an experiment with chicken : two cages of chickens had a similar food automatic device .	i think esa answered the question well and thus have awarded him the answer .
odds are , the cat 's as wary of you as you are of her .	some cats ( actually many , in my experience ) find it difficult to sit or stand still when they are being petted .
i ended up using a combination of the three answers provided with a slight twist .	as a reminder : there are many cats who have lived long and happy lives on dry food .
the biggest reason i can think of is that you 're taking away a defence mechanism for the cat .	cats don 't usually like to have their paws held , touched , or anything like that .
people here has answered very well but if nothing helps then barking control collars can help as a last resort .	you can 't expect your pet to keep mum if you are not with him .
depending on where you live , burying your pet in your yard may be illegal .	at only a few inches deep , it 's still easily detected by coyotes and foxes .
the two primary consideration here are the dogs safety and the ease ( or budget ) of improvement .	personally , i 'd be wary of leaving a dog outside alone without a physical fenced boundary .
breed zebra danios are extremely hardy fish , they are almost difficult to kill .	supposedly danios need to school which mean you need at least 5-8 danios in your tank .
diatomaceous earth claims say that it works on fleas / mites by microscopically abrading ( cutting ) their exoskeleton , essentially drying them out .	so called " natural " remedies are not necessarily : more effective ; or with less side effects .
cats are descended from desert dwelling animals and have their kidneys concentrate the urine very strongly to recover water .	this table from cornell university lists the specific gravity of urine for dogs , cats , and large animals .
it 's just her style .... my cats all have different eating styles .	i have a cat who does this , and have heard about the behavior in other cats .
at this stage , i would look to add fish and stop artificially adding ammonia to the system .	unfortunately i 'd say no , not if you still have that much ammonia showing up .
how could be you so sure that the fish died a natural death .	diet management of iodine intake for your cat is going to be very difficult with food intended for human consumption .
gastric dilation , also know as bloat , is a veterinary emergency .	it is often said that " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " .
it 's possible that your cat , like some people , has simply gotten more finicky with age .	as far as i 'm aware of , it 's instinctual , to avoid contamination .
no , goldfish do not " pair up " — not socially , and not even in breeding .	concern about lung development if you are concerned about your cat 's health , you should take your cat to the veternarian .
when a carrier is not a thing to be afraid of , things get a lot easier .	all but one current answers talk about " forcefully " putting the animal into the carrier .
the thing they hate in citrus is the oil ( which has the smell ) .	i found that " acts of god " can discourage and even teach cats from doing certain things ( e.g .
clean the urinated zone with vinegar ( i used to do that when my feline daughter was a baby kitten ) .	others have made some good suggestions about how to neutralize the odors in the area .
i have one maine coon but she does not do this behavior .	since we can 't know what moves inside a cat 's head , it will all be a theory only .
aristotle didn 't put the world at the center of the universe per se .	why did aristotle place the earth at the centre of an infinite universe ?
i don 't think that positivism is a position of mostly leftist philosophers .	i am not convinced that positivism is routinely asociated to a leftist ideology .
it 's a non-sequitur , which means that the conclusion " doesn 't follow " from the premise .	it 's fairly clear in this case that the problem is simply a false premise .
if everything has a cause , then god must have a cause .	there is something rather than nothing because the state of " nothing " is unstable .
i do not think the possibility of holding contradictory beliefs is controversial .	i 'm not certain the preface paradox , as stated , holds water .
strictly speaking i believe definitive knowledge is never obtainable , as karl popper has convincingly argued .	broadly speaking , knowledge is objective truth while belief is subjective truth .
you don 't write a dictionary first and then tell people to learn it .	no given dictionary for a language completely describes that language .
" to cause " means that there is an unbroken chain , ordered in time , that links from cause to effect .	the meaning of " cause " is very vague , it is a human term , not a scientific term .
in structural terms , the second sentence isn 't incorrect , you just read it incorrectly .	as the t isn 't mentioned in the part of fever ( x ) , we can push it inside .
well for one a being could have a non-physical existance and yet not even be in your mind .	the difference is huge , as not all non-physical things exist in minds .
as a thoroughgoing occasionalist , malebranche held that all causal activity is divine .	occasionalism is the position that god is the true and " efficient " cause of all that occurs .
dr julin jaynes speculates in his book ; the origin of consciousness in the break down of the bicameral mind .	this is a great question which calls into discussion the nature of groups at all .
in modern evolutionary biology , teleology is considered to be an irrelevant explanation for what caused things to be .	this is a huge question actually and one of considerable current research .
people who are good at the philosophy of mathematics are mathematicians and not philosophers .	my motivation is that i like to look at things from their roots and go up .
i 'm afraid i don 't have an answer for you , but perhaps i can offer you a somewhat useful non-answer ?	thanks for your help after much searching i could not find anything .
rational explanations follow from a specific set of axioms plus rules to go from step to step .	to evaluate a rational explanation , i think it 's important to distinguish correct from rational .
i too am interested in this budhist topic and offer a humble answer .	first of all : this is an excellent question , and deserves a better response than i can give it .
the difference between " necessary " and " sufficient " is the direction of the logical arrow .	sufficient is an upper bound , necessary is a lower bound .
this is much more a biology / evolution question than a philosophy question .	if limited life span was the result of generational evolution , unlimited lifespan would have been tried and rejected .
i have no idea why it is voted up , but rex kerr 's answer begs the question .	it 's a tautology , but the mapping between logic and the english-language description is wrong .
in the case that b , assume a and derive b to yield a implies b .	you can prove it indirectly as follows ( if steps ( 5 ) and ( 8 ) are acceptable to you , of course ) .
yes , if " natural numbers " is the commonly agreed on term from arithmetic .	this is more on the lines of commentary on your question , rather than an answer .
in the above process , nowhere the eyes are actually reading chinese , but converting it to signals .	the turing test enables the examiners to see if the judges are unable to distinguish the people from the robots .
it 's true that , under one understanding of " accessibility " and " determining " , your accessibility relation is determined by your axioms .	accessibility is determined by the axioms of the modal logic you 're working within .
i think this would be an example of a fallacy known as a red herring .	i don 't think it 's either an appeal to logos or pathos , but rather an appeal to ethos .
i think that the only difference between the two is the semantic objective of the definition .	( philosophy ) the system of thought holding that all phenomena can be explained in terms of natural causes and laws .
answering my own question , i 've found mit 's opencourseware to be a good starting point .	let me question your question briefly , then reassure you , then try to answer it .
though i mostly agree with cody 's answer , i wish to answer from different perspectives .	interesting theoretical answers aside , there is no such thing as " rights " or " entitlements " -- not really .
3 is in the set of integers but not in the set of even numbers .	this is not a mathematical argument , so no mathematical response is necessary .
you say this thing is older than the other , when both has measurable and finite age .	the proof is not valid and it isn 't even true .
i once met a physicists who held the strong ai position .	although i believe searle is mistaken , i don 't think you have found the problem .
the list is long , and will depend a lot upon your eventual area of specialization .	i minored in philosophy in college and trying to get back into it after 8 years .
consequentialism not only admits but advocates cruel treatment in exactly those cases where there is an overall benefit .	the experiments done by those other than mengele on prisoners by the germans saved more lives than they cost .
i can not refute the argument as it is perfectly sound .	yes , appeal to lack of evidence to the contrary has a name - > proof of burden .
i don 't think you can find a consistent distiction across philosophers .	i have long pondered this question specifically in reference to mathematics .
well , you can always limit the number of iterations or timeout to recover from " infinite loops " in decision procedures .	we 're paradox free because of the differing registers of both rational & irrational thinking we 're capable of .
the most simple example i can think of is the category mistake , a kind of fallacy .	this does not appear to be a kōan at all , but merely a story .
not necessarily tied to philosophy , but in formal debates the sides agree on a proposition to make arguments about .	" burden " is an artificial construct : a notion of a social responsibility .
if a statement is not provable an inconsistency or self-contradiction may or will develop that invalidates the system .	should arrival at this point be the focus for examination of any system ?
first of all , one needs to separate mathematical model from reality .	the question heading is understandable but i found the question body confusing .
i gave this a lot of thought a few years ago and came up with a test .	i take the google quote to be a jab at russia in terms of homosexuality .
i work in a quite technical field , that my wife knows nothing about .	i think the problem lies with the term " some concept " .
no measurement from inside the observed system can be informationally complete .	godel 's theorem i would like to pause here to first precisely state and prove the godel theorem properly .
the question is ( from hinduism ) ; do you exist because of pregnancy ?	the least that can be said is that we must be born with the ability and ' knowledge ' to learn .
let 's see - god made human and able to improve it , people made computers and can improve them too .	we do not yet know whether the brain is " understandable " in the sense that we accept now .
marxist theory was developed in the 19th century by two german philosophers , karl marx and friedrich engels .	yes , there does exist such a philosophical idea that radically changed the world in the twentieth century .
are we anthropormising the world when we incorporate cause & effect into our understanding of how the world acts ?	the question you 're asking is the main reason kant wrote the critique of pure reason .
i don 't know about hinduism , but you jumped of the track right off the bat with islam .	point # 1 - i only know a little about the judeo-christian-islamic traditions that assume a moment of divine revelation .
off the top of my head , i think it 's better to look at the criteria you 've proffered for identifying " god " .	a good argument i have seen against the existence of a god is based on occam 's razor .
the existence of different logics is interesting , but not particularly relevant , because of gödel / turing universality .	in today 's mathematics , we have many variants of logic ( propositional , first order , higher order , fuzzy logic , etc . ) .
first , you 've got to be more specific about the " laws of physics " .	the answer is yes , no and maybe - the answer being dependent on whether one takes an empirical or philosophical perspective .
sophie 's world by jostein gaarder polarises opinion as it is a history of philosophy wrapped up in a children 's story .	if you like reading you must check out copleston 's a history of philosophy .
" god is exactly this substance underlying who supports , exist independently of , and persist through time changes in material nature .	i 'd argue that matter and energy are substances in the category of empirical scientific knowledge .
i think that for an understanding wittgenstein 's " solution " , you must take in account the original ( historical ) context .	wittgenstein is alluding to how russell himself solved the paradox - the theory of ramified types .
this line of thought has a rich tradition in philosophy .	no , i don 't think it is wise to see emotions and intelligence as algorithms .
forget for a moment that you ever learned anything about so-called " complex " or " imaginary " numbers .	as others have already mentioned , numbers are of course abstractions .
the question of time is an incredibly difficult one , which has been treated of philosophers from aristotle to heidegger .	wikipedia , as much as it is a supposedly self correcting medium , is not necessarily a definitive account of anything .
what you are asking about is the nature of causality , which is one of the stickiest problems in philosophy .	in " ideal " conditions , for example ( warm temperature , moist environment , bacterial presence , etc ) , mold will grow on bread .
here is an example of philosophy helping a breakthrough in mathematics ( in differential topology ) .	do we expect musicians to have contributed to the state of the art of quantity surveying in the last 20 years ?
discussions about the contingency of mathematical properties should definitely consider the existence of non-standard models ( see the related mathoverflow reference request ) .	it depends on how you describe a mathematical object , and what you call " a single " mathematical object .
not all negative claims can be validly reformulated into positive claims .	i don 't think the burden of proof is on positive or negative versions .
this is classic " nature versus nurture " debate , and if you study psychology you 'll never hear enough of this .	predestination : religious arguments over predestination are useful here , along with more recent points about quantum mechanics and chaos theory .
our greatest asset for comparison , basically , human and animal have similar purpose in life , those are , survival and enjoyment .	cicero 's hortensius , though effectively lost to us , appears to have been an answer to this very question .
first , you must be using humanist in an idiosyncratic way .	if everyone can create " meaning " based on personal preference not some philosophical idea it will amount to contradiction .
most contemporary philosophers would interrogate the concept of happiness , pain , and even " human nature " .	from a survival prospective , it is clearly not necessary to be happy to survive .
i haven 't read it myself , but i 've heard good things about delacampagne .	there is " philosophy in the twentieth century " by alfred ayer which is quite good .
this is much more a biology / evolution question than a philosophy question .	the answer is for at least this domain of problem is that prices are quantised and not continuous .
people almost always have " rational explanations " for the things they do .	i don 't think we can say anything about this case .
they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety .	two components of just war theory come in to play when considering restrictions on liberty .
as i understand it , nothing that can be changed , or broken down into smaller parts is inherently real .	our interactions are merely depends on where we put our perception .
knowledge , of the kind you 're asking about , i think , usually requires evidence and reasoning .	suppose i flip a coin and don 't look at it .
first , other sciences can have their concepts explained without math .	one way to think of mathematics is " the study of patterns " 1 .
this varies depending on which logical system you 're working in .	a syntactic proposition can be evaluated to be correct or not semantically via truth tables .
" how objects are named " is something of a mystery to me .	the closest thing to the " study of naming objects " today , it seems , would be semiotics or semiology .
i can imagine a scenario where a single all powerful god create the universe that we know of .	it is the same idea as what aristotle called the unmoved mover .
the similiarity between kant 's and wittgenstein 's trains of thought has been expounded before for sure .	the question seems to presuppose contemporary sources are the best way in to philosophy .
a more idiomatic paraphrase of ~ ( x ) bx is : not everything is a bird .	you 've actually ( perhaps unintentionally ) asked a controversial question in the philosophy of logic .
on a temporary basis and as an ongoing personal philosophy selflessness is possible but a consistent selfless life is unsustainable .	anything we do based on our thinking and our emotions .
this argument is about as sensible as saying that -1 is absurd because a negative apple doesn 't and can 't exist .	you overlook that human color experience is an overlay of the input of three color receptors .
if not , what is preventing " happiness " from being quantified , in principle ?	we use zero to represent a piece of information : that is , that there is zero of some collection .
personally , i think u just identified one of philosophies greatest weakness , the lack of practical value .	philosophy is one of many human endeavours to find a meaning in life , and universe , and so on .
nothing is very difficult to conceptualise - we only approach it by analogy .	the principle of sufficient reason states that nothing is without reason , but why are there any contingent truths ?
in zen , validation occurs by recognition by a validated practitioner in a ceremony / event called dharma transmission .	wikipedia does a good job of summarizing the four stages of enlightenment , which are stream-enterer , once-returner , non-returner , and arahant .
interpreting infinity = 0 mathematically is problematic for reasons that niel de beaudrap outlined .	yes , there is at least one philosophical idea that addresses the uniqueness of existence , infinity coming out from one ( see e.g .
they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety .	there is not a single " philosophical angle " on this topic .
please see " a foray into the worlds of animals and humans " with a theory of meaning by jakob von uexkull .	is it an acceptable idea that each individual carries their own model of reality in their mind ?
so , i will tailor my response to your comment to chaosandorder .	modal logic is an extension of classic propositional and predicate logic that allows the use of modal operators .
from an atheist philosophical standpoint , how is existential contingency explained or accounted for ?	my whole use of the word " dream " -- probably yours too !
read the paper friederich nietzsche and the seduction of occam ’ s razor by danesh-meyer , helen v.young , julian , 2010 .	i 've begun seeing ockham 's razor as being a statement about cognition and learning , and not about the construction of reality .
death penalty is a punishment , ( in theory ) reserved for the most heinous of crimes .	the way you stated your question , i 'm not entirely clear what you are asking .
his theorem applies to the way the mind works as well .	there is no reason that human can 't create machines as powerful as themselves .
zizek actually has touched this subject a couple of times .	i 'd suggest that post-cold war communism and marxism no longer poses a threat , the big other is now political islam and / or terrorism .
expanding upon joseph 's comment : special relativity rules out the possibility of absolute simultaneity .	for simultaneous events in different spatial locations see other replies .
download the reading guide on logic books from http : / / www.logicmatters.net / students / tyl / § 1.2 gives recommendations for complete beginners .	this line of reasoning does contain the naturalistic fallacy : monkeys are wild animals , and they live in the jungle .
you might try carnap 's famous ( but often neglected ) der logische aufbau der welt ( the logical structure of the world ) .	one fixed static universal language would probably run into issues illustrated by berry paradox and similar paradoxes .
in solipsism everyone else is a " philosophical zombie " ; and all the time .	the gödel – cohen result establishes the independence of ch from zf ( with or without ac ) , not from any set theory whatsoever .
time is a physical factor and the term used to capture this concept is the word ' time ' .	so in the sanskrit language the time is synonym of death .
will be supertrue ( superfalse ) iff under all ( no ) acceptable precisifications of the predicate " bald " , the sentence comes out true .	principle of non-contradiction : " a proposition p and its negation ~ p cannot be true together .
it seems that you are really asking what we mean by " rational " .	rational explanations follow from a specific set of axioms plus rules to go from step to step .
you may find in recent philosophical letters ( e.g. , collapse , in particular vol .	fear is not quite a lack of control , but more a lack of knowledge .
when i needed a travel tripod , i also opted for a trekpod .	an alternative tripod that may serve your needs is the trekpod .
i finally found one of the best astrophotography articles i 've ever found on the net .	i am pretty new to the astrophotography scene but i have learned fairly quickly .
to answer your question , yes , this is a design issue .	in answer to another question of mine , matt grum left a couple links that describe focus shift .
fast picture viewer has an extensive pack for the low price of $ 9.99 and it appears to cover them all .	fast picture viewer is $ 9.99 and works just fine on 64-bit windows 7 ( i 'm using it myself ) .
there are many compact cameras with underwater housings available from canon and olympus .	there are waterproof compacts that go to 10 meters , such as some of the olympus tough models .
apart from aperture and focal length , depth of field also decreases with camera-subject distance .	the wider your aperture , the smaller your focal depth will be .
i can 't speak for canon cams , but in the nikon world generally one should stick with nikon brand batteries .	one of the easiest choices is to buy brand name batteries .
when printed on a lens the f-stop is usually expressed as a ratio with a colon ( i.e .	it refers to the maximum f-stop ( which is defined as the ratio of focal length to effective aperture diameter ) .
the key is adding some specific tags every time you import .	i have a horrific naming scheme that renames based on exif taken date and the md5 hash of the photo .
some of the newer point and shoots do great in manual mode .	i found that when i switched to a dslr from a point-and-shoot digital , the quality of my photos improved dramatically .
the interface between acr and photoshop has changed a couple of times over the years .	adobe in their wisdom decided to force you to upgrade photoshop if you splash out on a new camera model .
a more expensive option is a remote trigger like the wireless pocket wizards and the cable for your camera .	i am very happy with the phottix plato it is a wireless solution that is cost effective .
it is important to remember that rgb is an additive process , and cymk is a subtractive process .	i 'm not quite sure what you 're asking , but i 'll try and cover all the bases .
there 's no simple rule of thumb due to the inhearent nonlinearity in the equations .	depth of field formulas are indeed complex and nonlinear , but they still afford useful rules of thumb .
although you could fix this problem in lightroom with reasonable results , you can fix it when taking the picture .	the old way of solving this problem , i mean before digital post-processing , was to apply foundation cosmetics on the model face .
ken rockwell claims , and i agree , that the d5000 in quiet mode is pretty darn quiet .	from what i 've read and seen , i don 't think there is any real significant difference between 1.5 and 1.6 .
i used to think that blurring was one of those things that was impossible to recover from in post .	if the photo is blurred due to camera shake , you really don 't have many options .
if you took a look at the image that your camera initially takes , you 'd be disappointed in it .	i may be wrong , but i don 't think that what you are looking for is feasible .
in my ( admittedly limited ) experience , in-lens stabilization ( nikon d90 + 18-200mm ) works a lot better than in-body ( pentax k200d + 18-250mm ) .	lenses are generally the most expensive part of photography equipment and likely to be kept longer than bodies .
for what it 's worth , dirt on the lens might not be as detrimental as you would think .	there 's no " right " way to do this , it 's what works best for you .
you need to be embedding a color profile in you image , as also using a browser that supports color management .	in my experience , when the final production will be in srgb , use that color profile from start to finish .
firstly words , even technical terms , change meaning over time with usage .	the only construction-agnostic term would be long lens to compliment the other lens classes : wideangle and normal .
i have a few nikon lenses , and a sigma 10-20mm for super-wide shots .	if your interest is primarily the optics , you need to look at individual lenses , not brands as a whole .
if you are looking for something that really won 't move , i do recall of the cotton carrier line of products .	+ 1 for the black rapid series - i have one of those myself .
i have found there is no single best way to increase size .	there are a very wide variety of solutions for resizing and sharpening images for use on the web .
the smaller the camera sensor size , the higher the crop factor , and thus the higher the effective focal length .	the greatest zoom range of any camera is the canon powershot sx30 is .
use a large aperture ( small f number ) when you take a photo .	apart from aperture and focal length , depth of field also decreases with camera-subject distance .
you need either to remove the offending light or supply much more additional light to wash out the reflection .	you can 't remove the reflections , but you can change what gets reflected .
i simply got a refurbished older model point and shoot for my 5 year old .	it will really depend on how mature your kid is .
bokeh is a bit like evaluating wine , there 's some technical evaluation and some subjective evaluation of it .	the areas which are out of focus are blurred in a shape matching that of the lens opening .
cleaning the glass is a great suggestion , however , even with clean glass you have a few more issues .	i can 't speak directly to aquariums , however i 've done shots at zoo 's before .
a canon at 300ppi , you have the same tonal range as an epson at 288ppi .	emprical study : extreme digital upscaling for all of the theory above , thats all it currently is ... theory .
it simply means there are lots of pixels in your photograph at that brightness level .	if the histogram shows everything bunched up at one end , then have either a very dark or very light image .
shutter priority for shots that i want to control how much the action is frozen or blurred ( panning ) .	i have my camera on p by default and switch to aperture priority when i care about depth of field .
i 've used paint shop pro and dxo optics pro on windows .	in linux i use bibble , which is has some warts but which is the only serious option afaict .
the only construction-agnostic term would be long lens to compliment the other lens classes : wideangle and normal .	well , to use wikipedia as well , it would appear that the options are telephoto and long focus lenses .
apart from dpreview.com , you can use snapsort if you 'd like something more flashy .	i 'll second dpreview , they have very comprehensive reviews and as mentioned , the side-by-side comparisons are excellent .
a class 6 card in theory should be more than enough bandwidth for hd ( 1080 ) video for the 550d ( 48 mbit ) .	some cards are too slow to accept an hd stream , so you need one that is fast enough .
bear in mind that the aperture will usually have to be set manually too .	apart from aperture and focal length , depth of field also decreases with camera-subject distance .
they could , on the other hand , more easily extend their own raw format ( s ) .	there is something particularly conceptually wrong with throwing away the stuff that comes out of your camera .
personally , i just guess , take a shot and look at my histogram and tweak as needed .	its not linear , its a square , so if you double the distance , you need 4 times the light .
aside from the better quality of the ef-s 10-22mm lens , it offers a significantly wider angle of view .	the 10-22mm lens is the perfect complimentary to the 18-55mm when it comes to nature and small room photography .
bibble pro is a cross-platform program similar to lightroom and aperture .	there is ufraw , which is based on dcraw and can be integrated with gimp .
here are many samples : pbase.com out of the 16k photos there , i 'm sure some are with a d700 .	it 's a 1 : 1 lens , so that means that the size of the subject will be the same size on the sensor .
there are literally dozens of tripods that can handle more than two pounds .	in general it is difficult to satisfy those 3 important properties at the same time : light weight , sturdiness , and cheap .
the one clear benefit of digital that i see is the ability to emulate color filters in software .	the most obvious , and most distinct , difference will be cost .
i second the approach of a standalone gps tracker and then using some software to sync it into your metadata .	canon 's official method is to use a gps unit with their wireless file transfer accessories .
i would thoroughly recommend a read of trey ratcliff 's excellent hdr tutorial .	the short answer is no it 's not possible to create an hdr image from a single raw file .
depends on your budget obviously , but some cameras have dual card slots and can write identical files to both .	how about using an apple ipad with the camera connection kit accessory .
i believe you 're out of luck with ie , though perhaps that may get corrected in ie 9 .	unfortunately , there is nothing you can do that is practical .
same here , i 've the 50mm f / 1.4 , and as my fastest lens i couldn 't live without it for concerts and low-light photography .	i have the 18-55 , 50 / 1.8 and 50 / 1.4 as well as the 20d - superseded by a 50d .
i use elinchrom skyports , but if money is not an issue then go for pocketwizards .	or just go with the ultra-cheap yongnuo rf-602 , which give you a lot of bang for the buck .
i had good luck switching the image into lab mode , then adjusting the luminance layer only .	you can use fill light and reduced contrast to lift the shadows .
the short answer is that yes , you can do this .	speaking from my own experience , i would rather carry different nd filters that combine two polarisers .
there is no set rule for this ; it all depends what you want to photograph .	a lot of the recommended sizes for different image types ( 2 : 3 , 4 : 5 ) are based on the availability / cost of printing in those sizes .
well , i 've searched for this for a good long while .	there is some discussion on flickr here aps : advanced photo system .
dodge and burn normally applies when you want to change the relative exposure of part of an image .	i like the way a burning vignette produces a more realistic result as opposed to a simple " fade to black " .
i 'd go with the sd 1300 , just check if you mother-in-law feels comfortable with its size .	it 's very hard to buy a bad point-and-shoot at the moment .
photoshop elements is $ 99 and is very close to photoshop in terms of features for photographers but much cheaper .	the wider your aperture , the smaller your focal depth will be .
the most important fact - which is buried in one of the previous responses - is focus speed .	stabilization is primarily intended to help when your shutter speed is less than the reciprocal of your focal length .
to follow up on genius ' reply , dp review had a waterproof camera group test last year .	i got my young daughter a cheap olympus stylus tough 6000 .
they could , on the other hand , more easily extend their own raw format ( s ) .	another advantage is that the manufacturer 's raw files are better supported by post-processing software .
chinon ceii that my dad gave me as a student .	a nikon em , sort of a point-and-shoot beginner 's slr , that i got in high school ( way back when ... mid 80s ? ) .
nick miners.com nick is a friend of mine who posts articles on his blog covering a range of photography topics .	chase jarvis is an excellent resource for pro behind-the-scenes stuff , lots of excellent material available as a podcast .
i don 't know about nikon , but i did the same thing on the canon side .	i believe that the 70-200 accepts a few specific 1.4x tcs quite well .
the terminology is usually called " destructive vs non destructive " editing .	lossless / nondestructive edits are reversible and would entail transforming and / or appending the data in a way that could be reversed .
use a high speed page feed scanner like the dr-2010c from canon .	another suggestion : wait until you have money to throw at the problem .
you can use free , open-source utility exiftool to extract the metadata from the jpg files .	why not stop using jpeg images and use raw exclusively ?
two things need to be considered here : focusing speed and adequate sensitivity to light to achieve a fast shutter speed .	often a faster lens will be sharper even at the same aperture as a cheaper lens .
i think this is an example of : use the opportunities you have , rather than the ones you wish you had .	polarizers and neutral density filters will go a long way to help this , but they are not a panacea .
there 's really only one thing you need to memorize and it 's easy : a list of standard f-stops in graduations of one f-stop ( 1 , 1.4 , 2 , 2.8 , 4 , 5.6 , 8 , 11 , 16 , 22 , 32 , 45 , 64 , 90 ) .	for the exposure , you can try an analog light-meter , like the gossen lunasix .
i upgraded from 400d to 7d and things just got sharper ( and you should expect the same ) .	it has to do with the sensor size - large sensors require correspondingly larger lenses .
reid is right - that vr does not help at all in stopping motion .	completely agree with reid ... in this situation a fast prime is the way to go .
in short : you can enlarge it as much as you like .	that all depends on the viewing distance , and , to a lesser degree the brand , age and speed of the film .
if you can find a used 7d i 'd jump on it , but chances are , you won 't at a price oyu 'll like .	" background compression " is part of how we perceive perspective in a photograph .
there are numerous kinds of optical abberations that you may encounter with a lens .	i 'm trying to write down a more photographer oriented answer .
sometimes the amount of exposure compensation available ( ie + / - 2 stops ) in aperture priority mode might simply not be enough .	manual mode can give you more consistent metering when you 're taking several photos in a scene .
the camera will only ever do a " quick format " as there is a limit on read / write operations on flash memory .	i format my card every time i stick it in my camera and start a shoot .
i have the 35mm 1.8 and the 50mm 1.4 - and for people wanting thier 1st fixed prime i always point them at the 35mm 1.8 1st .	only when we consider all these factors do we come up with a ' normal ' focal length value of about 50mm .
for what it 's worth , dirt on the lens might not be as detrimental as you would think .	regular dish washing fluid is great for removing grease , as it not only dissolves it but also binds it .
polarizers do block light , as they are designed to filter out light coming from certain directions .	aside from focal length , the most important thing to consider is the maximum aperture of the lens .
if you 're not feeling the limitations of your point-and-shoot camera , then you probably don 't need a dslr .	they aren 't better per se ; they just tend to allow greater artistic control over the result .
if you are a member of costco , their prints are great .	they 're not the cheapest , but the quality is superb , so i 'm a fan of whcc .
i don 't bracket with digital unless i 'm blending multiple exposures to get greater dynamic range .	i highly recommend building into your gestalt a certain bat sense about when to use bracketing .
definitely shoot in av ( aperture value ) mode and vary the shutter speed !	well part of sunset photography is luck with the elements .
i know you asked for free stuff , however given that i whole-heartedly agree with reid about how valuable your time is .	pisca provides basic photo editing tools ( crop and colour and level adjustments ) as well as good exif tagging .
large-format cameras are very much worth buying used ; they 're often extremely well-cared-for , if not coddled .	if i had to pick , linhof would be my choice .
basically , you must understand three settings : film speed , aperture size , shutter speed .	the best way to learn is to start photographing more — both for the basics and for more advanced photography .
most dancefloor lights are tungsten , so unless you 're using flash you should be okay with that .	i shoot in raw on auto-wb , and then adjust to taste in the raw processor .
adobe photoshop elements is actually a pretty good package these days .	there are quite a few alternatives , depending somewhat on what you 're after .
the exposure settings to stop moving objects depends entirely on how fast the objects are traversing your frame .	most important : put your camera down for a while and make a snowman !
first of all , what you have is probably mirror pre-fire rather than a true mirror lockup .	mirror lockup is used to reduce vibrations with longer exposures .
if you 're primarily interested in video , the nikon option offers 1080p and 24 frames per second with autofocus .	i 'd recommend reading an article from philip bloom , a professional filmmaker who uses dslrs on a daily basis .
if the photo is blurred due to camera shake , you really don 't have many options .	well as nobody has posted anything yet i thought i 'd cheekily point you in the direction of my own blog .
anil , there certainly is a difference in results , mainly in image quality .	if you want to learn photography , almost any camera will do to start with .
i just found a page that has some information about this .	hold your camera close to your body ... stand with your elbows bent and your arms against your sides .
most digital cameras use a 10 to 14-bit a / d converter , and so their theoretical maximum dynamic range is 10-14 stops .	there is an easy trick : " measure " for yourself : take your camera .
understanding exposure by bryan peterson is a great and easy to read book that covers these topics .	if you own adobe photoshop , you should get " the photoshop book for digital photographers " , also by kelby .
freezing motion generally requires one , maybe two things : fast shutter speed , and flash at the right time .	in addition to @ pearsonartphoto 's answer , you can use flash ( either the built-in or better yet , an extarnal ) to freeze the motion .
i 'm a bit biased , but you might find my site , snapsort useful .	pogue on the canon s95 : http : / / pogue.blogs.nytimes.com / 2010 / 10 / 28 / a-love-letter-to-a-camera / i think he likes it .
the answer is no , since russia is one of the five permanent members of the security council .	there 's no such thing as misuse of the veto right in the security council .
federal doma does not test the full faith and credit clause so much as the 9th and 10th amendments to the constitution .	doma as a congressional statute could not violate the full faith and credit clause of the constitution .
public employees can unionize because the law allows them to .	the legal reasons why public employees can unionize have been elsewhere described .
there are two challenges to online voting which can be seen as well technological as cultural .	the largest barrier to online voting is ensuring that fraud does not occur .
the u.s. appears to have a smaller shadow economy for a few reasons in no particular order .	there are three main factors that drive the low shadow economy in the us .
the united states has had a constant 435 members in the house of representatives since the reapportionment act of 1929 .	analysing the number of representatives in various countries , that number is in no direct proportion to the countries ' population .
leaving aside heath care angle , you are working from a flawed premise that waging war doesn 't save lives .	healthcare they would probably reject your implied claim that obama 's healthcare law will save lives .
the following is a synopsis and explanation of common beliefs the libertarian free market philosophy .	even the largest corporations ( e.g. , walmart ) are subject to competition , which is a key component of the libertarian philosophy .
" opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution " .	as they contribute to the federal budget they do also receive help from it .
the president is not really all that important for german people .	the function of the german president is almost just representative .
executive orders are not permanent , they exist at the will of the president and can be changed at any time .	congress tends to pass bills with language explicitly giving the president discretion over certain matters .
there are 2 problems with the viewpoint you presented in the question , which explain the seeming contradiction .	first , i think you do mean the republican party and not conservatism .
in a " first-past-the-post " system , it is difficult to sustain more than two parties .	while the ' first-past-the-post system favours two parties , it certainly doesn 't guarantee the marginalization of third parties .
great britain is used to formally refer to the uk ( including northern ireland ) in a number of international associations .	people use great britain , at least in my encounters , to talk about england proper ( i.e .
most democratic countries have a written constitution , but it 's not a requirement .	no , there are some that have none , but they are pretty rare .
the legal reasons why public employees can unionize have been elsewhere described .	public sector employees can currently unionize because president john f. kennedy signed executive order 10988 .
over time , parliament ( the lords and commons ) took more and more power from the monarch .	the checks and balances of the uk parliamentary system are very different from the us , but they do exist .
they were called " freedom fighters " in the west through 1980s when they were fighting the ussr .	they are called " terrorists " because they engage in what is commongly understood to be acts of terrorism .
legal case information is generally easy to come by if you poke around a bit .	they are called " terrorists " because they engage in what is commongly understood to be acts of terrorism .
the part of economics that is most like physics is called microeconomics .	side note first : i don 't think that physicists always agree on their theories and predictions .
yes it is technically possible that a buk system shot down the plane .	this is a vice news clip of a ukrainian military an-26 transport shot down a few days before mh-17 .
" teabagging " is when a male dips his scrotum upon another person 's face as an insult .	" teabagger " is yet another shining example of " civil discourse " by left wingers in america .
some lobbying comes in the form of giving campaign contributions to politicians .	the problem with the lobbying is that people choose their representatives to represent the interests of the voters .
being left or right were obvious when being right was being for monarchy and being left was being for republic .	the crisis is one of the biggest fact that have increased the nationalisms in the politic field .
tl ; dr : if non-dictatorial communist societies existed , then not for long .	the democratic election of communist salvador allende in chile in 1970 represented an " experiment " in democratic communism .
simply , it was not well thought out , and the " unintended consequences " are now revealing themselves .	this answer is based on the response in the comment clarifying the question .
let me share my opinion as ukrainian citizen , from kharkiv , eastern ukraine .	i am sure this is more phylosophical and ethical question than it seems .
nowhere does it say that a naturalized citizen has the same privileges as a natural-born citizen .	the 14th amendment extends equal protection to all citizens , natural born or naturalized , so that no state can abridge their rights .
most people want not only to be well off , but to become better off as time goes by .	to start , the main drivers of economic growth are resources , technology , and institutions .
when having discussions on anarchist / anarcho-capitalist forums , i 've come across this issue a couple times .	in an anarchy , quarreling parties would be unrestricted to come to a lawful agreement .
first , they already have , that is part of the reason for the conflict in the first place .	in addition to all the other answers , another reason is the sheer difficulty .
the vice president is elected because it is constitutionally required , as per the 12th amendment .	the original conception of the us presidency was very different than it is today .
so do they basically stop paying their vendors such as the electric company or rent on buildings ?	what money are the using to pay down the debt ?
i 'm not yet able to answer if the phenomenon has an official polisci name .	there are 2 problems with the viewpoint you presented in the question , which explain the seeming contradiction .
let me make something incredibly clear up front : while i come across as rather angry , i 'm not .	it 's a mixed / hybrid goverment , integrating elements from almost every one of the basic forms of government .
these are generically called nomination rules ; the us calls them ballot access rules .	in the originally-envisioned system , presidential electors are appointed by the states ; the states decide how those electors are chosen .
no , nothing in the patient protection and affordable care act grants the president transitional authority .	there is always " transitional authority " by virtue of the writing of regulations .
federal doma does not test the full faith and credit clause so much as the 9th and 10th amendments to the constitution .	congress does not have to currently justify the laws it passes .
both of your bullet points are correct , and both are wrong .	the democratic election of communist salvador allende in chile in 1970 represented an " experiment " in democratic communism .
in german , the term " nahost " or " naher osten " ( near east ) are in common use .	the term far east usually refers to east asia , including mongolia , china , korea , japan , and southeast asia .
in lebanon ( and in some other places ) ' christian ' is as much an ethnic and cultural as a religious designation .	christians and muslims in lebanon both are separated internally in their political point of view toward syria .
while these criteria are normative , there are solidly defended norms out there for these meanings .	during the french revolution the most radical politics were sitting on left site , the most conservative on the right .
wikipedia has a short list of articles about lgbt groups and individuals opposed to same-sex marriage .	wikipedia has a good breakdown of the different flavors of this argument in this article .
some of the gap could be attributed to social issues , but that may not account for the entire gap .	biology in the modern western world , males have a lower life expectancy for two important biological reasons .
one has to separate out two elements of this - first is ' voter ' and second is the difference between ' knowledge ' and ' interest ' .	congress tends to pass bills with language explicitly giving the president discretion over certain matters .
the jerusalem is a holy place for both muslims and jews .	you are correct that the israeli-arab conflict has not resulted in nearly so much death as ongoing conflicts in africa .
equality is widely accepted because it can mean so many different things to so many people .	many times we judge the plausibility of a theory based on it 's outcomes .
after posting this question , i received the february 1st - 7th edition of the economist .	there have been several studies , most of which have found no movement in class mobility over the past several decades .
i think the best way address your question ( s ) is by using a legal analysis .	" to put it succinctly , hamas is using its own citizens in the gaza strip as shields .
the word " libertarianism " was essentially invented because classical liberals felt that the word had become expropriated .	first of all , as usual in politics , you got definition confusions galore .
i would rather have added this as comments to the question and to nl7 answer but do not have the reputation ..	this touches on a foundational question of political philosophy and international relations : peace & trade versus war & plunder .
probably the best measure of a candidates ideology is the dw nominate score .	as he 's a member of the republican party , that 'd make him a republican .
what troubles most people about same-sex and sibling marriages is their likely impact on childbearing .	i think the best way address your question ( s ) is by using a legal analysis .
one result , perhaps unintended of the split between the senate and the house is that they have rather different constituencies .	the u.s. congress didn 't actually start out bicameral ; the original articles of confederation ( the pre-constitution ) had a single house .
the holocaust took place to some extent within germany , and german jews / gypsies / homosexuals were taken to extermination camps .	an important factor is the posture of german versus japanese leaders .
well when it comes to a developing country there wouldn 't be a huge impact .	i would like to share a link to league of nations as an example .
russian federal law is actually quite specific on this one and not as arbitrary as argued .	the last round of presidential elections in russia was held on march 4th , 2012 and december 4th , 2011 for the duma .
when having discussions on anarchist / anarcho-capitalist forums , i 've come across this issue a couple times .	i often like to point to the workers councils of hungary in october – december 1956 as a " pre-figurative " form of life without a state .
to make a tactical vote , you need an estimate how much votes each candidate is probably going to get .	let us first ask what are the implications of tactical voting ?
this question has already been widely discussed and answered on skeptics .	minimum wage laws hurt the least skilled , least productive the most .
according to shia muslims specially iran state and hezbollah a country called israel does not exist .	as with the definition of palestine , the definition of israel varies depending on whom you ask .
whenever you hear about " politicians receiving money from corporations " it almost always refers to campaign contributions rather than personal gifts .	the justification is likely personal and wide ranging across the political spectrum .
you are asking a fairly broad question , so i need to tackle a few points before answer it directly .	basic income is often held up as the method to deal with widespread unemployment as a result of mass automation .
they do it for the same reason why some stadiums sell their good tickets by lottery .	at least in the case of h1-b visas , the annual quota is typically exhausted within a week .
i disagree that there 's " no other choice " than to be funded by public organizations .	i wish to provide an answer with a concrete example of why funding pure mathematics is a fruitful endeavor .
i am from hungary and i looked for hungarian source of poland , polish and other keywords on jobbik website .	all translations mistakes are mine , so don 't judge the sources based on possibly poor use of english .
the federal reserve has been conducting open market operations for many decades ; the law was passed in 1913 .	can the fed choose not to claim securities that they are holding , that are due ?
in the election of 1872 , grant easily beat horace greely , 286 to what would have been 66 votes for greely .	it 's essentially a remnant from a time when the u.s. political system worked differently .
both of your bullet points are correct , and both are wrong .	it 's not possible to be politically neutral , though one should always strive to be objective .
in theory , that would be the case if all workers were equal .	total expense 8000 after limit company has 100 workers making 10 / hour for 6 hours producing 700 units .
border issue : there is certainly a border issue between india and bangladesh .	ultimately , the answer is that the archivist of the united states gets to decide what " ratified " means .
as you see , the answers and comments here also contradict each other .	there were absolutely no articles , blogs , or studies that i could find that suggested causation at all .
most political ideologies are in favor of restricting the behavior and thoughts of just about everybody , young and old .	legal drinking age of 21 is quite extreme of usa , compared with legal age for having sex as little as 15 afaik .
as michael ws points out , a ' first past the post ' system ( which the us has ) encourages a two party system .	the two party system is reflective of our system of voting .
" teabagger " is yet another shining example of " civil discourse " by left wingers in america .	( i 'll try and post a less overtly biased and editorialized answer .
many countries significantly reduced their debt by defaulting on it .	one of the provisions that the us made under the articles of confederation was the land ordinance of 1785 .
in short , you can 't because the supreme court has recognized the right to lie .	as much as i 'm for honesty , such a system would probably be untenable .
the government can 't force a business to act , but they can punish them for not acting .	simply put , this is exactly the question that elaine photography is going to decide .
the reason it changed is the term " liberal , " suffered too much damage to it 's brand , particularly during the years pres .	liberal : using existing laws and government to do good for everyone .
the entire social contract tradition on which most modern forms of government are based depends on equality of certain rights .	many times we judge the plausibility of a theory based on it 's outcomes .
at a very simple level , the answer is that not all rights are financial .	i see only benefits of such a system without any major drawbacks in the long run .
crimea is a very fertile agricultural region , and is often seen as a vacation spot for russians .	a good example of what you are looking for is from the city & county of san francisco .
your forgetting the most dangerous criminals , the trained professionals , the law enforcement officers .	police aren 't omnipresent , and you can 't just instantly summon them upon demand .
because there are more effective ways for her majesty to change or veto laws .	they do not veto laws because nobody will ever adopt a law which is contrary to the expressed queen 's will .
absolute majority always defined by the institution , or the context .	in countries like india , when you have 2 / 3 of the seats of all parliament , you have absolute majority .
hospitals are legally bound to stabilize a patient , but that is all ; so many life-saving operations still will not be performed .	the first statement is largely true , and the second one is largely false .
the french constitution of 1946 ( fourth republic ) established proportional representation ( at the level of each departement ) .	i 'm not quite sure what the question here is , but i 'll give it a shot .
inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth .	the standard terms of left and right politics originate from the seating arrangement of the french national assembly of 1789 .
professor burkhauser has done extensive research on who is hurt by higher minimum wages .	minimum wage laws hurt the least skilled , least productive the most .
the nazi party was called nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei ( national socialist german workers ' party ) .	i think this question illustrates that a simple division of politics in left and right is an oversimplification .
well , there is distinction between extremist party and an anti-democratic party .	the democracy is based on the principle of the freedom of expressing one 's thoughts , both individually and in groups .
in massachusetts , you walk into the polling place and state a name and home address belonging to a registered voter .	how do states without voter id laws ensure that people are who they say they are ?
in a roundabout way , there 's some truth to that statement , though it 's a bit more nuanced than that .	what your friend told you likely stems from comments made by our current attorney genrral , eric holder .
the democratic election of communist salvador allende in chile in 1970 represented an " experiment " in democratic communism .	it 's not possible to be politically neutral , though one should always strive to be objective .
the university constituencies are modelled on the university constituencies in use in britain in 1922 when ireland became independent .	this is still a representational form of gov 't , but with a unique twist .
in the age of empire , these were totally different things .	these terms seem to be used interchangably - by whom and where ?
there are conflicting philosophies and approaches to this ( and frankly , no good or clear answer ) .	trying to look at ' all of humanity ' or ' what 's best for germany ' aren 't useful questions .
the government can 't force a business to act , but they can punish them for not acting .	the rights / protected classes you are talking about are equal protection issues , which fall under the 14th amendment .
this question can only be answered within a theoretical context .	basically electoral institutes are responsible for conducting the polls as per the present rule and regulations .
one argument sometimes made against federally recognized civil unions by anti-gay-marriage side is actually purely political .	the problem is that there 's no free dinner and someone pays for those benefits ( see http : / / www.expatica.com / de / finance _ business / tax / -tax-saving-possibilities-for-employees-in-germany _ 17099.html for example ) .
before you want to start the study of a subject , figure out what you want to achieve .	as eugene suggests , try to figure out what you want to achieve .
inbox zero means what it says : nothing what so ever is left in your in box .	it means nothing in the inbox is on your mind .
i would suggest starting from activeinbox ( used to be gtdinbox ) and see whether that fully covers your needs .	i 'd suggest using gmail 's integrated task manager ( google tasks ) rather than labels .
to me , the effectiveness of my system relates to my long , mid-range , and short term goals .	try to look at existing time management systems rather than starting from scratch and trying to reinvent the wheel .
eclipse below are list of eclipse shortcuts which i use almost everyday .	to train yourself to use keyboard shortcuts , unplug your mouse for a few days .
as others have mentioned , the irobot roomba is an excellent example of a household robot which does meaningful work .	i 've been happy with the irobot roomba for floor cleaning .
thinking on your feet is an essential skill for combat soldiers .	mostly it 's about getting over your fear of answering incorrectly .
the important thing i try to remember is just to pay attention .	i have been reading on this topic since i have asked this question .
i think just the typical kitchen timer is the best investment you can get ( for a physical device ) .	i purchased a timer at bed bath & beyond that has three separate timers and an overall timer / clock .
there are several ways to tackle this and it partly depends on the system you 're using .	under gtd , you need to think whether that 's actually an action or a ( mini- ) project .
use a firm sturdy chair like a kitchen table chair instead of an office chair .	buy a knee chair or one of these large balls to sit on .
the pomodoro technique was developed by francesco cirillo and is aimed at establishing a standard to measure productivity .	stephen covey , although also considered a management guru , is definitely one of the most well-known and sold personal productivity authors .
after your meeting , try to find a picture of them on the internet .	with any activity that you would like to make routine , there are three things you need to know .
i think the hesitation comes from the fear that you will not be productive during the session .	i get started by telling myself that i do not intend to finish whatever i 'm sitting down to work on .
there is not really anything you can do besides being a witness ; just try to get over it .	i have not noticed my other family members having the same degree of sensitivity .
i 've learned over the years that association is the key !	i have a nook color and i think it is great ! ! ! ! ! !
i 've found that usually when i 'm being introverted or quiet it 's because i 'm thinking mostly about myself .	i think it 's better to forget you 're an introvert or the word introvert .
i think you need to apply a little statistical thinking to this .	one general key to not feeling dejected is to avoid comparing yourself to others .
you 're right , someday / maybe vs actionable is an artificial distinction that induces mental resistance during the classification process .	someday / maybe items are things that you can 't or don 't need to do right now .
what folders you need depends a bit on your email client 's capabilities , and how you want to work .	just your inbox and one other folder for holding emails until they are to be acted upon .
what i do is wake up early ( around 6 ) and run for a while .	note that there are many medical reasons that could be the cause of excessive sleeping and extreme fatigue .
a quick research ( 1 , 2 ) showed me that the concentration of caffeine seems to peak about 30-60mins after ingestion .	the issue is that it never becomes useful in its true meaning .
so consider the idea that it might be your body trying to tell you something ...	your mention of the weather changes brings two thoughts to mind .
here 's a technique i 've developed without being aware of it : multiple browsers .	i agree with others that tracking your time is fundamental to the solution .
try any.do , apart from everything you want , it also has the ability to drag and drop tasks to organize them .	try wunderlist - it 's got all of the features you 're asking .
i have a standing / sitting desk at work and really like it .	as mentioned by other responders , it turns out that using a standing desk isn 't necessarily a perfect solution .
i used to struggle with the same desires for adventure , novelty and risk-taking .	you should break you comfort zone , if you wanna try something new .
even though the question has been answered i would like to add my answer .	i don 't know if i should say this , but if your job is making you anxious .
the second option is more realistic unless the book doesn 't have many pages .	actually , david allen defines a tasks as to long / complex when your can 't motivate yourself for that task .
i get started by telling myself that i do not intend to finish whatever i 'm sitting down to work on .	this has to do with having discipline to do something everyday .
i think this is a more sophisticated version of the questions we often get on gamification .	a nice article on flow in the workplace : http : / / www.fastcompany.com / 53713 / art-work it 's not easy , though .
when i am pretty excited about learning the stuff ) i sit down for studying i find myself browsing irrelevant websites !	if you 're reading books on programming , of course you 'll get bored !
bento can handle relationships , but i don 't think it can do what you 're asking it to do .	you want the closest thing to bento , running on windows ( or linux ) ... filemaker pro ?
the thing i like about evernote is that this is all they do ( for now ) .	google keep is only android and web , as far as i know .
structured procrastination gives some amazing tipps to trick yourself into doing something .	one of the great ways when working on large tasks is to break it in manageable bits .
the # 1 skill as all of us " intermediate " and " advanced " users know , is how to web search properly .	this may be kind of out of point but i felt you might need this advice .
the main app i use specifically for this is daytum .	massive ulterior motive alert but this sounds perfect for beeminder .
by definition productivity is measured by calculating the total output per unit of total input .	the pomodoro technique consists basically in working continuously in blocks of time , which are usually predetermined in 25 minutes .
let 's do this is the simplest , easiest , and best looking way to manage your daily to do list .	i use one called weave , and i found it very helpful .
your brain is already beginning to wind down as you see the end in sight .	i 'm writing here a few tips that can help you with motivation .
try anki : http : / / ankisrs.net / i hope it is the software you need .	i recently found an app called memonote that is definitely worth looking at .
stephen covey speaks about this topic in his book " seven habits of highly effective people " , in the chapter " be proactive " .	don 't pressurize yourself to stop the emotions immediately , be easy with them .
i think the answer from brian almost says it all .	it takes me a while to get somethings that others get quickly .
wisdom says broken heart is cured by another heart -- a new love definitely gets you over break-ups .	3 years that is quite some time , but throw away everything that reminds you of her .
i have been there too and i have managed to solve these issues by taking away the origin .	the language you are using appears to me to be limiting your choices .
to stick with the traditional pomodoro technique this is considered an interruption .	there is actually functionality in most browsers already in place to do just this .
some years ago i read that one standard deviation in iq ( ~ 15 iq points ) increased productivity by 1.6 times .	i may have found some weak evidence that they are negatively correlated .
try to apply what you learn by implementing a small project , don 't just read .	i 'd recommend looking into " the first 20 hours " by josh kaufman .
i 'm going to be very short : you should set a singular purpose ( goal ) for yourself .	i 'm asking for some resources ( books , websites , etc ) or personal advice that would help me overcome this situation .
i 'm writing here a few tips that can help you with motivation .	you are incorrect when you say these aren 't " important " when in reality it is important since it annoys you .
i find that a good strong espresso will give me a buzz within a few minutes .	a quick research ( 1 , 2 ) showed me that the concentration of caffeine seems to peak about 30-60mins after ingestion .
i tried listening to music also , but after some time your ears get hurt and that 's disturbing .	from my experience the noise-cancelling headphones will not work for longer periods .
