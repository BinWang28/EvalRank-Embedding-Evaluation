police say that 's a standard practice whenever a taser is used .	sounds like we are falling foul of the eu standard practice in the way we treat our nationals .

i lost my mum and i felt the same way , for quite a long time , so i think i understand how it is for you .	was worth just over £ 10k at the time with only 7,000 miles on the clock i think and i got it for £ 6,200 .
mike mcqueary is an interesting case in that he was practically raised to be a part of the penn state family .	i mean not even everyone in hk is a british national - only a proportion of the population are .
tens of thousands of americans !	and this was of particular interest .

in russia , 56 % positively evaluate the work of obama .	i am positively surprised about this choice .
this , had we be wiling to talk about it seriously at the time , would have been legitimate cause for concern .	had that been on the 5.30pm from victoria it would have been a goner .
they might be hiding him or something , in which case what is the problem ?	i said i complain the 3 or so times a month i ring with the same problem .
at least that is my hope .	@ edgarblythe , that is very sad .
why didn 't we ever hear about it during the bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled ?	but they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the bush admin .
it 's one thing if you are just lazy and forget , but its another thing to lie about diaper changes all together .	i am wrong about the unemployment rate , but every other point i made about obama is true .
none of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies .	so we now heve to wait for a decision to be handed down from the mountaintop .
i try not to assume i fully understand those i encounter , but i do react to things i see and i do have opinions .	i assume that if pronation is " normal " the shoes may be just fine ; if not , yes , i might see an orthopedist for an opinion .
